      <p>Life's been tough. To say the least. I've gotten a decent amount done in the
past week or so but I just haven't felt like writing about it. So instead of a
bunch of blogs I'm just writing the one. Another <code>life.swp</code>.</p>
<p>First, I've been using <a href="https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki"><code>vimwiki</code></a> for notetaking and generally anything I
just write down, tasks, etc., and was interested in trying to generate a site
from the Markdown files. Managed to do it using pandoc and a <a href="https://github.com/mas-4/vimwiki/blob/master/Makefile">Makefile</a>.
Apparently Netlify has pandoc built in, so now I can just deploy via git and it
stays updated. It's currently hosted at <a href="https://vimwiki.standingwater.io">vimwiki.standingwater.io</a>. Don't
mind the color scheme, it's pretty ugly and sure to change soon. I was
experimenting with Nord. Don't like the result in the least.</p>
<p>I recently started using <a href="https://www.instapaper.com/p/mas">Instapaper</a>, and paying for premium ($3 a month).
For the past year or so I have been collecting an absurd amount of bookmarks,
almost like a digital scrapbook of events (2020 has been movin' pretty fast, as
everyone knows). A ton of the bookmarks have been tweets, but there were still
an absurd amount of news articles, so I was interested in a more formal way to
archive this stuff, and to clean out my bookmarks. Instapaper doesn't seem to
handle tweets very well, but I've ported all of my news article bookmarks over,
and am just going through all of the ones I haven't quite read yet, and the
&quot;read laters&quot; that have been building up in my feedly for nigh on two years.</p>
<p>It took some work trying to get an Instapaper link in my headers on
standingwater.io and blog.standingwater.io. They aren't available as FontAwesome
icons, so I had to use SVG's, and the result feels just a little more hacky than
I'd like. These sites are so personal and will be with me so long that I have an
interest in modularizing them and making them very easy to modify and extend, so
I will probably be finding a way to improve on what I have. I actually have been
getting a little dissatisfied with standingwater.io and am inclined to code up
something myself instead of using the template it's built with.</p>
<p>More interesting, though, is that I want to use the API to automatically (or at
least programmatically) download all of my highlighted selections and notations
from Instapaper and write them to markdown files in the <a href="https://vimwiki.standingwater.io/passages/index.html"><code>passages</code> portion of
my vimwiki</a>.</p>
<p>More to the point, life has been pretty tough precisely for one reason: the job
hunt. It is not going well. I get a response from one in twenty companies, and
of the responses I've gotten, only two have led to an interview, one of which I
choked on, and the other one of which I completely blew by forgetting about it
for the fifteen minutes it was scheduled for. The second one, most ironically,
originally said it was just for equity (part of the reason I blew it off) and
now says is for $120k. God that feels so shitty.</p>
<p>Sometimes it feels like I'll never get a job. That I am doomed to make $12 an
hour for the family company for the rest of my life. It gets hard thinking that.
I'm trying to stay positive, but ho boy is it difficult.</p>
<p>I made a comment on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/threads?id=annowiki">Hacker News</a> about anno.wiki and was pleasantly
surprised by the feedback I got. It just re-iterated to me that the reason it
failed was multi-fold, but that I can still fix it.</p>
<p>I have learned a ton in the past two months. It is surprising how fast and
fluent a lot of tech learning feels to me now. This is part of the reason I feel
like I should be able to just get a job, but I understand rationally this is not
how the world works. My lack of professional experience weighs heavily against
me, even if I might be more experienced than a lot of juniors. One of the
interviewers with the first company I interviewed with said his best hire ever
was a Pizza Hut manager, so it's clear that it is possible. It's just hard as
hell to get your foot in the door. And with the pandemic, the future feels so
much more bleak.</p>
<p>I am fully confident we'll be entering a serious recession, if not depression.
It will rewrite the way we work, and the economy itself. I imagine that things
will be more remote, which, on the face of it, means it should be easier to get
a remote job, but I'm not confident that's the case. When a position is remote,
there is so much more competition because it's not geographically limited. I
just don't know.</p>
<p>I think that I need to do two things now.</p>
<p>One, formalize my application process. That is to say, I need to get a cover
letter system. It seems they are very helpful. I need to start using Hacker Rank
to apply for jobs. I need to start compiling a spreadsheet of all the companies
I apply for, what I apply with, when, and I need to start applying at companies
that don't have job postings.</p>
<p>Two, I am going to start redesigning anno.wiki. I'm going to go hard on it. I am
going to build an entirely new front end in ReactJS and relegate the current one
to https://old.anno.wiki. The following list of changes will be incorporated:</p>
<ol>
<li>Autocomplete omni search. I want you to be able to search for annotations,
users, and, most importantly, lines from the omni search bar, with
incremental response. This seems essential to the functioning of this app.
You need to be able to read Shakespeare in your bed with your own copy, write
something in the margin, think &quot;this would make a good annotation,&quot; go to
your desk, pop open anno.wiki, type the first few words of the first line
into the omnibar, and open the passage for annotation in less than ten
seconds.</li>
<li>A landing page. I might even pay for an impact video. This is something I've
been thinking about for six months, and the comments I got at HN made clear
that no one knows what to do with the site.</li>
<li>Analytics.</li>
<li>A React Native mobile app. This may, in fact, be the biggest boost to
utility. We will see.</li>
<li>As for more technical information, I want to use graphql in the front end.
There is a library called <a href="https://graphene-python.org/">Graphene Python</a> that allows you to easily (I
hope) incorporate graphql into python, and there's a specific version called
<a href="https://docs.graphene-python.org/projects/sqlalchemy/en/latest/">Graphine-SQLAlchemy</a> for SQLA. I am hoping this is easy to graft onto my
existing structures. I have become very used to graphql in the past six
months in writing Gatsby, and I like it a lot. The idea that I can build an
easy data api for Flask without writing an insane amount of routes would be
absolutely wonderful.</li>
<li>I am interested in migrating the database a bit. I have been thinking about
the possibility of using two different databases, one for data storage
(lines) and one for annotations, comments, and general CRUD operations. I do
not know. This is very future thinking, after I get the front end running.
I'm not sure how that would affect the SQLA, how it would affect the
cross-queries, especially the more complex ones that allow me to <a href="https://anno.wiki/tag/allusion/annotations">query all
annotations with a particular tag</a>. But we'll see. I like the idea of
having a database specific to persistent data, and keeping it separate from
all CRUD operations. It just feel safer and cleaner.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is going to be a big project. Hopefully not as big as building anno.wiki in
the first place, but we'll see. I hope I can get it done in 3ish months but that
seems extreme. I just don't know. I'm definitely hoping to <em>not</em> make another
year long project of it.</p>
