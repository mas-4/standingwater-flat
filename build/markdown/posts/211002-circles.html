<p>Lately I've been studying some Linear Algebra and felt like dipping my toes back
into some generative art.</p>
<p>It seems, whenever I start doing something like this my first step is to draw a
circle by radiating spokes from the origin. I always have to sort of rediscover
the math from first principles, so I felt like writing a quick post about it.
I'm going to walk through how I was thinking about this from scratch.</p>
<p>I'm using p5.js for these pictures.</p>
<p>First let's define our canvas:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">DIM = [500,500];
ORIGIN = DIM.map((el)=&gt;el/2);
</code></pre>
<p>This is obvious enough. Now, p5.js has two main functions: <code>setup</code> and <code>draw</code>
which are pretty obvious.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">function setup() {
  createCanvas(...DIM);
  background(255);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Color functions take a <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/color">variety of arguments</a>. In this case, we're
using one argument to define intensity of RGB I guess, 255 is <code>#FFFFFF</code>, or all
full RGB or white.</p>
<p>I'm going to do this with only three drawing functions: <code>line</code>, which takes an
origin and end point, <code>strokeWeight</code>, which defines the line's width, and
<code>stroke</code> which defines the line's color.</p>
<p>Let's just get something on screen.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">function draw() {
  line(...ORIGIN, ...DIM);
}
</code></pre>
<p>This just draws a line from the center to the bottom right (coordinates are
defined with <code>(0,0)</code> at the top left and increasing right and down, as with most
systems).</p>
<p><img src="./images/20211002135716.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Okay, now let's try looping over 360 degrees:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">function draw() {
  for (let i = 0; i &lt;= 360; i++) {
    line(...ORIGIN, i, i);
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>This will be hideously wrong, but I start naive. Always.</p>
<p><img src="./images/20211002135941.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Okay, we know, obviously, that we're drawing a lot of lines from (0,0,250,250)
to (360,360,250,250) which is pretty meaningless, it's obviously a diagonal line
because <code>i=i</code>. Let's try some trigonometry.</p>
<p>We know that every point on the unit circle can be described as a vertex on a
right triangle. Since this triangle is right, getting coordinates with some trig
shouldn't be too hard.</p>

<p>This is a classic Unit Circle (sourced from Wikipedia). Every point on the unit
circle can be represented as $(\cos{\theta}, \sin{\theta})$. But $\theta$ is a
radian, so let's do that right.</p>
<p>We know that $360° = 2 \pi$, so translating a degree to a radian as easy:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">rad = 360 / (2 * Math.PI);
</code></pre>
<p>Now, let's draw a circle:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">function draw() {
  rad = 360 / (2 * Math.PI);
  for (let i = 0; i &lt;= 360; i++) {
    line(...ORIGIN,
      Math.cos(i*rad),
      Math.sin(i*rad)
    );
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p><img src="./images/20211002141636.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Well that's not doing it. Let's think about this.</p>
<p>We're definitely converting our $\theta$ from degrees to radians. But now that I
think of it, the output of each of <code>Math.sin</code> and <code>Math.cos</code> has got to be
${\alpha : -1 \leq \alpha \leq 1}$, so we're just drawing a lot of lines from
the origin to a circle around the pixels in the top left corner. Really it's
just a square because it's the top circling around the top pixel and 3 pixels
outside the frame.</p>
<p>So let's recenter to the origin.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">function draw() {
  rad = 360 / (2 * Math.PI);
  for (let i = 0; i &lt;= 360; i++) {
    line(...ORIGIN,
      ORIGIN[0] + Math.cos(i*rad),
      ORIGIN[0] + Math.sin(i*rad)
    );
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p><img src="./images/20211002142044.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Beautiful, we have a dot. Our radius is 1 pixel, so it's a 2x2 pixel square
around the origin. Let's adjust the radius.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">function draw() {
  radius = 250;
  rad = 360 / (2 * Math.PI);
  for (let i = 0; i &lt;= 360; i++) {
    line(...ORIGIN,
      ORIGIN[0] + Math.cos(i*rad)*radius,
      ORIGIN[0] + Math.sin(i*rad)*radius
    );
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p><img src="./images/20211002142232.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Hey, we got a circle! Nice.</p>
<p>Technically this is all we needed. But let's try giving it some varied color.
We've got a nice variable <code>i</code> right there that describes a circle in 360
degrees. We could use the same sin wave we've already got to give our 3 colors
different degrees. Remember, the outputs of sine and cosine are always between
-1 and 1, so since our color scale is from 0 to 255 we'd basically have just
black lines if we don't normalize our scale to 255.</p>
<p>Since -1*255 is -255, we should move our color scale up to [0,2] by adding 1 to
the output of sine and cosine.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">s = 1 + Math.sin(i);
c = 1 + Math.cos(i);
</code></pre>
<p>Then we should scale to 255. We can't just multiply by 255, though, because when
either sine or cosine equal 1, s and c = 2, so $s \cdot 255 = 510$. Let's
instead scale by half of 255, so 127.5.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">s = (1 + Math.sin(i)) * 127.5;
c = (1 + Math.cos(i)) * 127.5;
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">function draw() {
  radius = 250;
  rad = 360 / (2 * Math.PI);
  for (let i = 0; i &lt;= 360; i++) {
    line(...ORIGIN,
      ORIGIN[0] + Math.cos(i*rad)*radius,
      ORIGIN[0] + Math.sin(i*rad)*radius
    );
    s = (1 + Math.sin(i)) * 127.5;
    c = (1 + Math.cos(i)) * 127.5;
    stroke(s, s, c);
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p><img src="./images/20211002143246.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>So right here I wanted to start experimenting with size and got a happy accident
I'd like to checkpoint as I was troubleshooting gain. If you just change <code>DIM</code>
to <code>[1920,1080]</code> you get this:</p>
<p><img src="./images/20211002144517.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>I'm not fully sure what's going on with that, but I like it. I'm going to
troubleshoot this point.</p>
<p>Fixed:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">function draw() {
  radius = 250;
  rad = 360 / (2 * Math.PI);
  for (let i = 0; i &lt;= 360; i++) {
    line(...ORIGIN,
      ORIGIN[0] + Math.cos(i*rad)*radius,
      ORIGIN[1] + Math.sin(i*rad)*radius
    );
    s = (1 + Math.sin(i)) * 127.5;
    c = (1 + Math.cos(i)) * 127.5;
    stroke(s, s, c);
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>I was actually centering the Y origin on the X origin, which means my origin was
offcentered vertically by $(x/2)-(y/2)$. Good to remember for future
experimentation.</p>
<p>In the meantime, let's mess with some stroke width. First I'm going to refactor
for some clarity (I'm trying to reproduce an effect I got earlier).</p>
<p>Ah, fascinating, I just found a bug: the line defining <code>rad</code> is backward. I'm
blowing up the definition of rad. It should read <code>rad = Math.PI/180;</code>.</p>
<p>Let's rewrite a bit, and get rid of my bad Python habits:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">function draw() {
  const radius = 250;
  const rad = Math.PI / 180;
  for (let i = 0; i &lt;= 360; i+=2) {
    let rads = i * rad;
    let xOffset = Math.cos(rads)*radius;
    let yOffset = Math.sin(rads)*radius;
    line(...ORIGIN,
      ORIGIN[0] + xOffset,
      ORIGIN[1] + yOffset
    );
    let s = (1 + Math.sin(i)) * 127.5;
    let c = (1 + Math.cos(i)) * 127.5;
    strokeWeight(i);
    stroke(s, s, c);
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p><code>Math.PI / 180</code> is the equivalent of $\frac{2 \pi}{360}$.</p>
<p><img src="./images/20211002145706.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Well that's a fascinating result. Let's scale it back up to 1920x1080.</p>
<p><img src="./images/20211002145852.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Fascinating.</p>
<p>Well, that's it. I just wanted to work through some of the math of programming a
circle.</p>
