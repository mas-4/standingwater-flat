      <p><a href="https://github.com/mas-4/vote">Github Repository for vote.py</a></p>
<p>I have a friend, let's call her Blaine, who is a reliable liberal, but has never
voted. She's 28 and has never registered. I pushed and I pushed and I pushed in
2018 but she never did.</p>
<p>Well, this time is going to be different. And I'm seeing to it.</p>
<p>I wrote a script to bug her by sending a text repeatedly, on a tightening
schedule, until the deadline for registration to vote in November in Florida.</p>
<p>The code for sending the texts was incredibly easy (though it cost around $20).
This might be attributable to the fact that I've done it before. (Some time ago
I wrote a script to run in the background of my home desktop querying
<a href="https://icanhazip.com/">icanhazip.com</a> periodically, saving the result to a text file, and texting
me if it changed.) You can literally just copy the code in the <a href="https://icanhazip.com/">Twilio docs</a>
and it will work. Super simple.</p>
<p>The code for getting the scheduler to run was a bit less trivial. It required
some thinking, but wasn't as difficult as I was anticipating. I want to talk
about the strategy I employ in vote.py here.</p>
<h1>Scheduling</h1>
<p>My requirements for this were pretty simple: I wanted to text Blaine on a
periodic basis, wherein the period shrank exponentially. But, I wanted to avoid
texting her at midnight, or outside certain pre-designated working hours.</p>
<pre><code>def runschedule(duedate, to, body, test):
    try:
        message = sendtext(to, body)
        SIDS.append((message, time.time()))
    except:
        print(&quot;Message failed. Trying again next time.&quot;)

    s = scheduler(time.time, time.sleep)
    seconds = getseconds(duedate, test)

    s.enter(seconds, 1, runschedule, argument=(duedate, to, body, test))
    s.run()
</code></pre>
<p><code>Sched.scheduler</code> works by entering the number of seconds to sleep until it
triggers a function which is passed through <code>sched.scheduler.enter()</code>. You can
schedule multiple events with different sleep times, but <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/2399145/9691276">the strategy for a
continuous repeating event is apparently to use the function to reschedule the
event</a>. Basically, just use it recursively. For me, this is the function
<a href="https://github.com/mas-4/vote/blob/802cda7cfa12fca74e8ecf800a9244b3c0a4e04a/vote.py#L85-L101"><code>runschedule()</code></a>.</p>
<p>I program somewhat iteratively and composably (if that's a word), so my next
question was: how do I get the number of seconds until a given date and time?</p>
<pre><code>def getseconds(duedate):
    freq = DEFAULTFREQ
    timetogo = duedate - dt.datetime.now()

    try:
        seconds = freq[timetogo.days // 30] # interval of months
    except IndexError:
        seconds = freq[-1]

    seconds = checkho(seconds)
    return seconds
</code></pre>
<p>This is actually still a fairly simple task. I have a habit of coding something
stupidly first and then fixing it more logically, so I started with a dictionary
keyed on &quot;months until the due date&quot; before I remembered that I could just use a
damn array. I generate the array as an exponential function: <a href="https://github.com/mas-4/vote/blob/master/vote.py#L21"><code>2^x * 1800</code></a>.
Then, in <a href="https://github.com/mas-4/vote/blob/master/vote.py#L56-L82"><code>getseconds()</code></a>, to determine the seconds until next event, I take
the difference between the due date and now using <code>datetime.datetime</code> (which is
an awesome damn library) and divide the number of days left by 30 (so,
essentially the months left). That gives the index in <code>DEFAULTFREQ</code> and the
seconds 'til T-Time.</p>
<pre><code>def checkho(seconds):
    ho = DEFAULTHO
    delta = dt.timedelta(seconds=seconds)
    t_time = dt.datetime.now() + delta

    if t_time.hour &lt; ho[0]:
        t_time = t_time.replace(hour=ho[0])
        delta = t_time - dt.datetime.now()
        print(&quot;Text would be too early, rescheduling...&quot;)
    elif t_time.hour &gt;= ho[1]:
        t_time = t_time.replace(day=t_time.day+1, hour=ho[0])
        delta = t_time - dt.datetime.now()
        print(&quot;Text would be too late, rescheduling...&quot;)

    return delta.seconds
</code></pre>
<p>But, now that I have that, that's not enough to schedule the text, because Now +
Seconds could be outside the acceptable Hours of Operation. So I wrote
<a href="https://github.com/mas-4/vote/blob/master/vote.py#L35-L53"><code>checkho()</code></a>. Checkho takes the seconds determined in <code>getseconds()</code>,
determines the date and time that is by adding
<code>datetime.timedelta(seconds=seconds)</code> to now, and then determing whether the
resulting <code>t_time</code> is before <code>DEFAULTHO[0]</code> or after <code>DEFAULTHO[1]</code>. In either
case, I just reschedule at the next <code>DEFAULTHO[0]</code>.</p>
<p>So there you have it. Surprisingly simple once it's written, like all code. I've
texted Blaine a handful of times already. The next text will go out tonight at
8:08.</p>
