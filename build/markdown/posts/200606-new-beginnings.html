      <p>Kind of a corny title for a first blog post, but it felt apt. I honestly don't
know which is cornier, the title of this post, or the style of my titling. I had
trouble writing the title template the way I wanted it so I just gave up and
went with something idempotent. I think I'm using that word right.</p>
<p>I've been diving deep into tech again, finally starting to apply to companies to
get a job in it. As a result I've been doing a lot of organizing of my dotfiles
and systems and learning a lot of new Python and React. This is the fourth
Gatsby site I've made so far, iirc. I like it well enough. Still not the biggest
fan of the whole npm ecosystem, or JS in general. God. Npm is slow as hell, and
there's nearly always an impenetrable bug. People think Python's internals are
difficult to understand. Lord.</p>
<p>So anyway, this initial post is literally just to provide a single slug to
compile the site for launch. I'm doing everything through netlify, which is
amazingly convenient, and seemingly a lot easier than ghpages.</p>
<p>I guess I can start writing posts on some of the stuff I've been doing:</p>
<ol>
<li>Re-ricing my arch was the first task.</li>
<li>Organizing dotfiles using <a href="https://yadm.io/">yadm</a>. Boy is that a great piece of software.</li>
<li>Writing more gatsby (this, <a href="https://standingwater.io">standingwater.io</a>).</li>
<li><a href="https://vimwiki.github.io/">vimwiki</a></li>
<li><a href="https://inthe.am">inthe.am</a>, <a href="https://github.com/tbabej/taskwiki">taskwiki</a></li>
<li><a href="https://kaggle.com">kaggle</a>, numpy, pandas, etc., and some courses on DS/Statistics</li>
<li>Lots of new vim plugins</li>
</ol>
<p>I guess I want to use this blog a bit more informally than I've tried in the
past. I expect I'm going to be writing politics here too, which may bug people
(if <em>anyone</em> ever reads this damn blog, which I somehow doubt, it's really just
for exhibition and my personal memory). I'd like to write shorter pieces, more
informally, about what I'm working on, problems I've solved, thoughts (I want to
adapt my original intro post for the previous ghpages blog FOSS as High Culture
because I really think it's central to my love of tech).</p>
<p>I also have a really lengthy discursion on the nature of the political mind from
my notes on Baudrillard that I'd like to adapt. I used to write daily, il y a
longtemps, and I'd like to get back in that habit, and not just in a notebook.</p>
<p>I guess I should say something about my theming. The main page,
standingwater.io, is inspired by the place I grew up: West Florida. We often
grow up thinking we live in the most mundane place in the world, but little by
little we realize how beautiful it really is. I've come to adore the swampiness,
the pines and palmettos, the muscadine growing all over like kudzu, the
ibises moving across a field of water in herds picking out bugs, aerating golf
courses.</p>
<p><img src="./images/palmettos.jpg" alt="Palmettos" /></p>
<p>I wanted to use this image as the backdrop for the home site, but it was too
busy, then I wanted to use it as the backdrop for this site, but it was too
gaudy, so I just gave up. There's something about it that is so... <strong><em>hygge</em></strong>
to me. I grew up thinking these palmetto strands were a nuisance, but adore them
now. I grew up thinking our longleaf pines were boring and common, but I adore
them now. This image is from the Wikipedia article on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osceola_National_Forest">Osceola National Forest</a>,
a good deal north of me, but closely resembles the preserve next to my house.</p>
<p>The logo is a heron, not because they are particular to me (in fact, I wanted an
Ibis) but because it was the only wading bird on <a href="https://thenounproject.com">thenounproject.com</a> that
didn't look like either a cartoon or a flamingo (which I distinctly did not
want). We have plenty of herons, of course, it's just the ibises are so
distinctly pervasive to Florida I wanted one of those.</p>
<p>The name of the site, Standingwater, is a throwback to the house I grew up in.
The yard would frequently flood, never dangerously so, but enough that it looked
like a marsh. The ibises would gather in the yard, and it would be hot and humid
for a couple of days while the excess water dried off. I jokingly named it
Standingwater in reference to Frank Lloyd Writ's famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallingwater">Fallingwater</a>. I was
going to use the name for a web design service but just went with it for my
portfolio site.</p>
<p>So anyway, I guess that's about all I have to say about that.</p>
