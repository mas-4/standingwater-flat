      <p>I spend a lot of time thinking about politics from a holistic perspective,
trying to understand the nature of political systems and progress and
persuasion. For instance, <a href="https://github.com/mas-4/government">I've recently been experimenting with writing some
code to simulate government structures and how they warp the political
persuasion of the populace into a more liberal or conservative country than
their people are by nature</a>. It doesn't work yet. It basically says the USA
is 100% liberal because it passes every proposed law. Obviously I have a bug.
But it's fun and interesting work.</p>
<p>I've been finding myself lately in some conversations with a few friends, one
French, another American, and I end up talking about the nature of power,
political persuasion, race, and progress in a much more fundamental way. I
figure it's time to start formalizing these thoughts into something like a
system. Or at least get them down in text.</p>
<h1><term>Openness</term> and <term>Closedness</term> are the Fundamental Political Axis</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Society is indeed a contract. It is a partnership . . . not only between those
who are living, but between those who are living, those who are dead, and
those who are to be born.</p>
<ul>
<li>Edmund Burke, Reflections on the Revolution in France</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I recently wrote <a href="http://localhost:8000/210329-negroni/">5000 words on the Negroni, Comfort Cocktails, and Political
Persuasion</a> that are probably far too discursive for their own good. But one
thing I repeatedly hammer on in that essay is the nature of openness and it's
relation to liberalness and conservativeness.</p>
<p>There's been a lot of hay made by the Economist set lately about the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open%E2%80%93closed_political_spectrum">open-closed political spectrum</a>. The idea is that this is the new political
dynamic. I find this intriguing. Not the concept of open-closed, but the idea
that this is new. I think the reality is that politics have <em>always</em> been about
open-closed. It's just that our politics have rarely been so starkly about
conservative-liberal differences. Because our political parties are not
<em>instinctually</em> political like we are. I'll talk more about this in the section
titled &quot;Race and The Wheel of Political Markets&quot;.</p>
<p>Breaking down political persuasion can be complex. We have the traditional
left-right division, the two dimensional political compass (where the vertical
axis is social and the horizontal axis is fiscal), and now a plethora of
different axes systems. I love taking them, and usually bookmark my results.
Some sites I've saved the results from have since gone dark, but here are some
of my results from different tests:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>Political persuasion is a mess of interests, identity, and social connections.
Even the political institutions in your country can influence the way citizens
recognize their political identity. In multi-party systems people often
gravitate into smaller camps (environmentalists, labor, commerce, etc) whereas
in big tent party countries like the United States and the UK political
persuasion is typically more holistic. In fact, there's some mathematics that
Political Scientists have developed that determine how many parties a given
democratic system can support. Which is why people that wish America was
multi-party make me roll my eyes. There are, in fact, <a href="https://youtu.be/TromTeBgwXY?t=1741">some <em>benefits</em> to big
tent two party systems</a>.</p>
<p>But this is too nitty gritty. A detailed analysis of political persuasion,
evolution, and identity on an individual level would find some really
interesting psychological dynamics involving group identity, personal interests,
knee jerk responses, and people with vaguely or ill-defined political attitudes
that become starkly polarized under different circumstances.</p>
<p>Conservatism and Liberalism have pretty obvious roots: <term>Conservatism</term>
is to conserve something is to keep it the same, prevent it from running out, to
be more reserved. <term>Liberalism</term> is to change things, accept new ways
of doing things, and be more open. These aren't controversial definitions.
Edmund Burke laid out Conservatism during the French Revolution pretty clearly:
it's to believe that tradition and historical institutions are meaningful and
worth keeping. And John Stuart Mill laid out Liberalism pretty clearly in On
Liberty: it's to be accepting of virtually anything that doesn't hurt anyone
else.</p>
<p>We can sit here and talk about how the modern Republican party is the
blow-it-all-up party and the modern liberal party is the party of big government
and regulation (not &quot;Libertarianism&quot; or &quot;Classical Liberalism&quot; as JS Mill
defined) but this is to really miss the point. Edmund Burke saw Conservatism as
not so much an ideology but an instinct. Because it is! It's not an ideology,
and it's not a system of philosophy with rigorous principes. And, in my
estimation, neither the hell is Liberalism, no matter what the Wikipedia wants
to say.</p>
<p>Adam Gopnik, my favorite essayist, recently wrote a book, titled <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Thousand_Small_Sanities">A Thousand
Small Sanities</a>, about the concept of Liberalism and how it just comes down
to a mentality of experimentation and progress. Learning through practice. And
this is the reason Liberalism tends toward big government economic solutions in
the 20th and 21st century and in no way resembles Classical Liberalism: Liberals
saw what unchecked capitalism can do. They saw the sweat shops and child labor
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle_Shirtwaist_Factory_fire">Triangle Shirtwaist Factory Fire</a> and <em>learned from it</em>. But that's
what Liberalism is about, openness to experience <em>and learning from it</em>, not
abstract concepts of &quot;liberty&quot; and &quot;rule of law.&quot; These concepts <em>are</em> liberal,
but they are not <em>Liberalism</em>. They are ideas spawned <em>from</em> the liberal
instinct.</p>
<p>Contrariwise, Conservatism is the instinct to fear change. It is to recognize
that systems are fragile, that people are dangerous, and that society can, and
<em>has</em> collapsed. As an instinct, Conservatism believes the people of the present
are <em>not</em> free, but are duty-bound to shepherd the treasures bestowed upon us by
the past into the future.</p>
<p>So in the end, I cannot see Open-Closed as anything <em>other</em> than
Liberal-Conservative, and I don't see how anyone can say otherwise. They are
inextricably, and biconditionally, the same dynamic.</p>
<p>And these two instincts are <em>fundamental</em>. Because politics is, and can <em>only</em>
be about, change.</p>
<h1>Conservatism and Original Sin</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>You could not step twice into the same river.</p>
<ul>
<li>Heraclitus</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I often coin pithy statements that conceptualize my thinking. <term>Liberals
learn from their mistakes, conservatives double down on them.</term> I usually
say this in the heat of discussion about how I can't stand Trumplicans. It's
unfair, but accurate, to the politics of today. But it really does a disservice
to Conservatism.</p>
<p>Politics is the power structure that controls a society's legitimate means of
force. It is no more, and no less, than that. Howsoever the means of force
within that society are controlled, directed, and deployed is what we would call
a government. This can be concentrated into one decision maker (a King, or, as
we would call them now, a Dictator), or spread out, as in the case of Athenian
Democracy. It can be strong, as in the case of the United States where it is
impossible to defy, or it can be weak, as in the case of Somalia where there are
multiple competing factions and the government is incapable of maintaining
control as the sole source of legitimate force. The book The Narrow Corridor and
its &quot;Shackled Leviathan&quot; is a really enlightening window into this concept.</p>
<p>But there is one, and only one, reality which politics has to contend with:
<term>Change</term>.</p>
<p>I feel like there's no reason to argue this, that no one can disagree, but it
would behoove me to at least provide a little evidence for this.</p>
<p>You grow old. New people are born. They will say new words, come up with new
concepts, dress differently, live differently, and invent new things. They will
try new things. Some of these things will be good, and other people will take
them up. They will start new traditions, listen to new kinds of music, and eat
different kinds of food. You grew up one way, and that way will no longer exist,
even while you are still alive. You will have to deal with this. How you deal
with this, how you react to this, <em>is your politics</em>.</p>
<p>I rag on conservatives because I'm an instinctual liberal. But I'm an
intellectual conservative, so I want to give them their due. Plus, I don't think
any serious thinker about politics ever wants to try to define their terms and
analysis such that they write off an entire half of the political spectrum as
just bad and wrong. Systems of philosophy should incorporate and understand the
purpose of the structures of their subject without prejudice. I have prejudice,
against Conservatism, but I have to admit its correctness, in a lot of ways. And
the reason for this is simple:</p>
<p><em><strong>You can go too fast.</strong></em></p>
<p>There's this <a href="https://michaelberryphysics.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/berry076.pdf">famous fact about collisions and billiards balls</a> that after
the sixth collision of a ball, in order to calculate the trajectory and speed,
you would have to take into account the gravitational pull of all the
individuals in the room, and that after something like the 56th, you'd have to
take into account every molecule in the known universe. It's often mentioned
when talking about how hard it is to make predictions, even in deterministic,
simple systems.</p>
<p>This is true in nearly every domain. For instance, we talk about how you can
kill one species and the result is a cascading domino effect of other species
dying out. They're called keystone species and we count among them frogs, bees,
and wolves. Well, society is a very, <em>very</em> nondeterministic and complex system.
Making a change to society, no matter how well-intentioned, can easily have
unintended consequences. Can easily have <em>bad</em> consequences. Societally
destructive consequences.</p>
<p>One easily observable example is the emergence of reaction. I'll get to reaction
a little later, but consider the conservative who feels completely disconnected
from his society. It is a not-uncommon phenomenon that right wing violence
increases in times of extreme change. When people feel their way of life is
threatened, they tend to get angry, and violent.</p>
<p>There are certain deep, sublime, and terrifying truths about the human race. One
is that we are all capable of evil. Another is that we are all just talking
apes. We evolved, and are genetically destined, to have certain instincts and
behaviors that we are incapable of controlling. There are a lot of ways to
interpret the concepts of The Fall and Original Sin, but one very useful
interpretation is this: We are all sinners. We are all capable of evil. We
cannot avoid perpetrating that evil until we understand, recognize, and accept
that we are. And part of that is understanding, recognizing, and accepting that
those around us are <em>also</em> capable of that same evil.</p>
<p>This is the conservative fear. We can move too fast, break something we don't
understand, and the result is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust">a</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holodomor">mass</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Chinese_Famine">outbreak</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_Revolution">of</a>

your society is stronger than that?</p>
<p><strong><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_racial_violence_in_the_United_States">You're</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milgram_experiment">wrong.</a></em></strong></p>
<h1>El sueño de la razón produce monstruos</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Reason is, and ought only to be the slave of the passions, and can never
pretend to any other office than to serve and obey them.</p>
<ul>
<li>David Hume, A Treatise of Human Nature</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="./images/goya.jpg" alt="The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters" /></p>
<p>Goya's painting, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sleep_of_Reason_Produces_Monsters">The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters</a>, is a kind of
leitmotif on this for me. There's a handful of names that come to mind that
inform my thinking about this link between Conservatism, Original Sin, Change,
and the Sublime: Edmund Burke, Francisco Goya, Sigmund Freud, Friedrich
Nietzsche, Carl Jung, and David Hume.</p>
<p>I'm just going to talk about Hume and the Belgians.</p>
<p>When I was starting on my road in philosophy at USF, I had to write a paper for
Phi 101 about some philosophical subject. I chose free will because I thought I
could prove it exists through some convoluted logic regarding Uncertainty in
quantum mechanics. It was a very freshman thing to think. I ended up
<em>disproving</em> free will by some old fashioned logic we find in Hume.</p>
<p>Basically it goes like this: what is free will? Let's assume we have it. When I
take some action, I have an internal volition to perform this action, and I use
reason to determine the correct course of action. This volition must be free
will.</p>
<p>Okay, so what is this volition? It's a passion. A feeling. But where does it
come from? Either I am in control of it, and therefore it is my will, or I am
not and it comes to me from some internal process that is out of my control.</p>
<p>Supposing it is in my control, how does my will to control it generate? Where do
the volitions to control my volitions come from? Supposing they come from my
reasoning about what is best for me, where does my desire to control this
volition toward what is best for me come from?</p>
<p>You see, we have a bit of an infinite regress. What's called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homunculus_argument">Homunculus
Argument</a>. This is because free will is an ill-defined concept that
evaporates upon examination. At base, we are, even in our own desires, outside
our own control at some basic level.</p>
<p>I eventually learned that this is basically what Hume was arguing in his defense
of soft determinacy (as opposed to hard determinacy, that the universe is
basically just a set of complicated equations which can (ostensibly) be
calculated n-moves out to predict the future). But the idea is deeper than that
because of its implications in human society. And for this, we can turn to the
Belgians.</p>
<p>These deep subliminal volitions over which we have no power, if we don't pay
attention to them, can <em>irrupt</em>. This is the basis of Psychoanalysis and the
work of Sigmund Freud.</p>
<p>There's this terrifying phenomenon in Belgium, where euthanasia is legal even
for mental disorders. In Belgium, you can choose to self-euthanize for
depression. Logically, this makes sense: depression can be a life-long
affliction and a humane society would allow you to end your life rather than
suffer from it for the rest of its span.</p>
<p>But is it humane? It's, to quote an excellent article on the subject:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>utopia realized: everything is neat and clean and terrible.</p>
<ul>
<li>Herman De Dijn quoted in <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-death-treatment">The Death Treatment</a> by Rachel Aviv, New
Yorker, 2015</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It is when we become too detached from our subconscious passions and volitions
that things begin to seriously derail. Examine Hannah Arendt's observation of
the banality of evil: the holocaust was perpetrated as an almost bureaucratic
exercise entirely devoid of feeling. The feeling that motivated this
bureaucratic machine was unexamined: reason assumed passion was irrelevant.</p>
<p>I am in no way suggesting that <em>reason</em> is to blame for this, it is precisely
<em>reason</em> which can prevent atrocities. But it is reason's <em>ignorance</em> of passion
that allows them to be perpetrated.</p>
<p>I am not a hippy. I am not back-to-nature. I am not one of civilization's
discontents. In fact, I despise anti-modernists that assume the past is better
than the present. The present is, <em>demonstrably</em>, better than the past. But I do
recognize that these three phenomena, and most evil today, are irruptions of
reason's dismissal of passion.</p>
<h1>Political Persuasion as the Genetics of Social Evolution</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn</p>
<p>Suicide remarks are torn</p>

<ul>
<li>Bob Dylan, It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There's something more to be said about the conservative instinct as a balance
to the liberal instinct.</p>
<p>You cannot have a biological system without some mechanism for passing on
information. We call this DNA. We literally begin talking about biological
systems by starting with the evolution of information systems for reproduction.
DNA actually <em>had to evolve itself</em> so there are earlier systems for passing on
information, but it is the fundamental construct of any biological system: an
information system.</p>
<p><em>BUT</em>, you likewise cannot have advanced organisms and their evolution without
mutation. For every generation there are numerous mutations that occur. Some of
these are beneficial. They are reproduced and become a part of the main trunk of
genetic code for that species.</p>
<p>There are an insane amount of other features of evolution, including genetic
drift, functional equivalence, and spandrels, but at its most basic form, any
evolving, biological system has some means of passing on information, and some
means of introducing change.</p>
<p>This ability to evolve is not actually about progress. It's about dealing with,
and adapting to, changes in the environment. It changes, all the time. Climates
change, geography changes, the species around you change. If a species is not
adapting to a new environment, <em>constantly</em>, it will be out-competed,
out-reproduced, and it will die.</p>
<p>Well, as should be pretty obvious, a society is a massive organism.</p>
<p>Conservatives preserve the societal adaptations of the past while liberals
produce the changes for continuous adaptation. Naturally, these forces are
opposed, but symbiotic. Without Conservatism, without the preservation of the
past, there can be no evolution, no progress. Likewise, without Liberalism,
without mutation, there can be no evolution, no progress. Only a static, dying,
decadent society.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the neurotics, radicals and reactionaries, want to either destroy the
Body Politic to build some new frankenstein society, or retrograde into their
Peter Pan Syndrome fantasy of society's childhood.</p>
<h1>Extremes and Neurosis</h1>
<p>I like this evolutionary metaphor for political persuasion. I like it a lot.
They don't call it the Body Politic for nothing. One thing worth considering is
disease: when either of these forces becomes too strong. Namely, autoimmune
disorders and cancer.</p>
<p>I love to draw a spectrum like this:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;----Radicalism--------Liberalism--------Conservatism-------Reaction----&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The point on which my theory gets shakiest is here. On the extremes. Sometimes I
think Radicals are fundamentally different from Reactionaries, sometimes I think
the Horseshoe Theory is fundamentally right. Honestly, I think it <em>is</em> right.</p>
<p>I always want to call Leftists Gauchists, which is just French for Leftist.
Leftist implies a symmetry with Rightist, but that's not a good word, so I'm
just going to keep calling them Radicals.</p>
<p>You can get so liberal that you don't learn from experience and try new things
to advance, but instead actively seek some ideal future that you have in your
head. We can call this <term>Radicalism</term>.</p>
<p>You can also get so conservative that you don't remember the past and think it
was better than the present and want to go back to it. We call this
<term>Reaction</term>.</p>
<p>The term radical is thrown around as not having a political position but it
really does. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_politics">Wikipedia</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The word radical derives from the Latin radix (&quot;root&quot;) and Late Latin
rādīcālis (&quot;of or pertaining to the root, radical&quot;). Historically, political
use of the term referred exclusively to a form of progressive electoral
reformism, known as Radicalism, that had developed in Europe during the 18th
and 19th centuries. However, the denotation has changed since its 18th century
coinage to comprehend the entire political spectrum, though retaining the
connotation of &quot;change at the root&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&quot;But Michael, a word is only what it means to the people who use it!&quot; Shut the
fuck up, most people use the word &quot;Conservative&quot; to mean Republican and
&quot;Liberal&quot; to mean Democrat and they have no idea what they are talking about. A
lot of words only mean what people use them to mean (e.g., decimate, literally,
silly), but other words have real meanings that continue in serious places but
of which the larger populace is ignorant. That doesn't mean the word doesn't
mean what academics use it to mean.</p>
<p>Regardless, just as mutation can result in cancer, and the protective instincts
of the immune system can start attacking itself, liberals can degrade a society
by <em>moving too fast</em> and conservatives can degrade it by <em>rejecting all
progress</em>.</p>
<p>That is to say, a &quot;conservative&quot; is okay with progress, just as long as it's
slow, doesn't destroy the society, and is rooted in the past: Burke saw the
American Revolution as justified by basing its plaints in the Americans' Rights
as Englishmen, and the French Revolution as entirely <em>wrong</em> because it based
its plaints on idealized Platonic rights invented by the mind. Whether you agree
with him or not, he's representative of a conservative system of belief. Our
Declaration of Independence is as much Burkean as it is Lockean, even if that
seems anachronistic:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be
changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath
shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable,
than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed.
But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same
Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their
right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new
Guards for their future security.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have a hard time understanding the mechanism of Horseshoe Theory, but I have
little doubt that it is real. By <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horseshoe_theory">Horseshoe Theory</a> I am of course referring
to the theory that the left-right political spectrum is more like a horseshoe
than a line, that people on the extreme left and extreme right almost touch.</p>
<p>I think that we can safely just gloss over this fact by pointing out that both
radicals and reactionaries are dissatisfied with the present, and so want to
destroy the current order, not just change or tweak it. At least, that's what
I'm sticking to for now.</p>
<h1>Political and Financial Power</h1>
<p>Okay, now that we've established how I see political persuasion, change, and
evolution in the body politic, I'd like to get into how I see the larger
evolution of politics and society.</p>
<p>I am an amateur philosopher. I studied it in school, so I know a lot of names,
and a lot of summaries of philosophers, but I'm not exactly &quot;well-read&quot; in a lot
of the philosophers that have influenced me. You might call me a poser, I say
I'm just really good at extrapolating full systems of philosophy from synopses
of theory.</p>
<p>There's an interesting dispute in social philosophy: what is the root struggle?
What is the root motivation of all human interaction? There's a lot of names
that don't directly argue with each other but that propose different
motivations. Freud believed <term>sex</term> was the basis. Marx believed
<term>capital</term>. Foucault, <term>power</term>. I'm inclined to believe them
all, because they're all just about <term>survival</term>. With sex, you
reproduce and survive. With money, you have power. And with power, you can
ensure your survival.</p>
<p>It's become a bit of a refrain that the West used to believe that with economic
freedom political freedom would follow and that the West was wrong, and China is
the proof. The refrain is correct: political power is the ultimate power, in
that it has the power to end financial power. Whenever any political power is
too concentrated, it will be abused, and usually to negative economic effect.
Because people with power will abuse it. <term>Power corrupts, absolute power
corrupts absolutely.</term> These are all goddamn clichés, but they're clichés
for a reason.</p>
<p>Whenever any group of people has advantage over another group of people,
whenever they have <em>power</em> over that other group of people, they will use that
power to their own advantage. This is the reason democracies often become
colonialist empires (see, for example, the United States and Athens). People
outside of that democracy have no political power within that country, and so
they are easily subjugated by that power. I'm on pretty shaky ground here,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust">because I'm directly contradicting the theory that democracies don't go to war
with each other</a>. I think, though, the reason for that is largely economic:
democracies are almost always free market nations, and why go to war when you
can make money?</p>
<p>Countries like China, where power is absolutely concentrated in a nondemocratic
oligarchy, can have economic prosperity in the short term, but can never escape
the runway of its own potential corruption. No matter how large the country is,
concentration is relative; I don't care that the National People's Congress has
nearly 3000 members, the country has 1.3 <em>billion</em> damn people. Futhermore, that
Congress is not as &quot;free&quot; to vote its conscience as the legislatures of the
West.</p>
<p>The reason for this is fairly simple: prosperity is inextricably linked with
economic freedom, and when a power capable of restricting that freedom is
concentrated, it will be abused to restrict that freedom for its own benefit. If
you doubt the necessity of economic freedom for a nation's prosperity you can
stop reading now. There exists no controlled economy in the history of the world
which has ever prospered in the long term (i.e., on the order of even a hundred
years).</p>
<p><em>On the other side</em> we can see a plethora of examples where too weak a
governmental institution results in poverty. The United States from 1880-1940 is
a great example of this: poverty was rampant, inequality was extreme, and abject
misery was the law of the land during a period of extreme economic freedom.</p>
<p>We can also see interesting examples of hypercapitalism where foreign
corporations take advantage of weak local governments to turn a profit. The
Bolivian Water Crisis is a fantastic example of this.</p>
<p>There is something fascinatingly perverse about financial power. It is utterly
intractable, mechanistic, unable to <em>think</em> beyond the simple concept of profit.
The mechanism is obvious: if a company does <em>think</em> beyond profit, another
company will beat it. It's nearly evolutionary. Financial power has no
conscience, no long term vision, no sense of selfhood. It is ineluctable.</p>
<p>And because it is entirely evolutionary and not at all dependent upon choices of
the people, it requires a check: the conscience of politics.</p>
<p>There are two powers in any country: financial and political. A society can only
truly be free when they keep each other in check.</p>
<p>The financial power of a society is almost alimentary. It exists to feed

<h1>Concentration of Power and the Origin of Political Institutions</h1>
<p>I have always been fascinated by popular movements, like the protest movements
in the sixties and the color revolutions in the 80s. It wasn't until I found
Gene Sharp's book <a href="https://leftvalues.github.io/results.html?a=1.5&amp;b=57.8&amp;c=16.7&amp;d=75.0&amp;e=50.0&amp;f=26.4&amp;g=29.4">Waging Nonviolent Struggle</a> that I learned there were
comprehensive studies of popular movements as a phenomenon. I devoured that
book, and then bought and read all three volumes of his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Politics_of_Nonviolent_Action">The Politics of
Nonviolent Action</a>.</p>
<p>Gene Sharp's work is especially fascinating because he lays out a pretty
comprehensive theory of power and politics. It has profoundly shaped the way I
see the world. In fact, his theory is not too different from that of Varys in
Game of Thrones:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Oh, I think not,” Varys said, swirling the wine in his cup. “Power is a
curious thing, my lord. Perchance you have considered the riddle I posed you
that day in the inn?”</p>
<p>“It has crossed my mind a time or two,” Tyrion admitted. “The king, the
priest, the rich man—who lives and who dies? Who will the swordsman obey? It’s
a riddle without an answer, or rather, too many answers. All depends on the
man with the sword.”</p>
<p>“And yet he is no one,” Varys said. “He has neither crown nor gold nor favor
of the gods, only a piece of pointed steel.”</p>
<p>“That piece of steel is the power of life and death.”</p>
<p>“Just so… yet if it is the swordsmen who rule us in truth, why do we pretend
our kings hold the power? Why should a strong man with a sword ever obey a
child king like Joffrey, or a wine-sodden oaf like his father?”</p>
<p>“Because these child kings and drunken oafs can call other strong men, with
other swords.”</p>
<p>“Then these other swordsmen have the true power. Or do they?” Varys smiled.
“Some say knowledge is power. Some tell us that all power comes from the gods.
Others say it derives from law. Yet that day on the steps of Baelor’s Sept,
our godly High Septon and the lawful Queen Regent and your
ever-so-knowledgeable servant were as powerless as any cobbler or cooper in
the crowd. Who truly killed Eddard Stark, do you think? Joffrey, who gave the
command? Ser Ilyn Payne, who swung the sword? Or… another?”</p>
<p>Tyrion cocked his head sideways. “Did you mean to answer your damned riddle,
or only to make my head ache worse?”</p>
<p>Varys smiled. “Here, then. Power resides where men believe it resides. No more
and no less.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a fairly hand-wavy description, and Gene Sharp's theory is far less
nihilistic than Varys's, but the ultimate realization is that power is a
collective psychological trick, a kind of mass interlocking fiction. But that
<em>doesn't make it fake</em>.</p>
<p>One of the most fascinating results of Gene Sharp's analysis is to recognize
that the resulting government structure after its formation derives, almost
linearly, from the source of its creation. Governments formed by small groups of
elites tend to be less democratic, and governments formed by masses of peoples
tend to be <em>more</em> democratic. This makes sense, intuitively, because if a small
group of people form a government, they necessarily want to hold onto the power
they already have, and don't trust those outside their group. There are
exceptions, glaring exceptions, like the United States, I'd say, but in general,
these principles hold.</p>
<p>The result in Sharp's analysis is that political change brought about by
nonviolent action tends to result in more democratic institutions than that
brought by violence. This is because violence is a limiting force. Neither the
old, nor the sick, nor the very young can wield it. Therefore, those bringing
about the political change through violence, are a subset of the population who
will wish to keep the power they've gained.</p>
<p>By contrast, in popular nonviolent movements, anyone can take part. Literally,
anyone, and the old, and young, and sick are sometimes the most powerful
fighters. Because one major weapon of nonviolent action is motivating the
sympathy of the opponent through pathos. There are other factors, and I strongly
encourage anyone to read through Gene Sharp's works to learn about them, because
he convinced me, quite <em>rationally</em>, that nonviolence is always the answer, and
violence never is.</p>
<h1>Concentration of Power and the Curse of Natural Resources</h1>
<p>This theory is not <em>just</em> Gene Sharp's. I derive a large part of my
understanding of the diffusion and concentration of power and its effects from
the book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_Nations_Fail">Why Nations Fail</a>, which bases its analysis on a simple rule:
nations with extractive institutions suffer poverty because of the inherently
corrupting nature of power, and nations with inclusive institutions necessarily
prosper because of the freedom of opportunity offered to their citizens.</p>
<p>One other result of this analysis, that prosperity is intimately linked with the
diffusion of power, is that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_curse">Resource Curse</a> instantly becomes
explicable.</p>
<p>The Resource Curse is &quot;the phenomenon of countries with an abundance of natural
resources (such as fossil fuels and certain minerals) having less economic
growth, less democracy, or worse development outcomes than countries with fewer
natural resources&quot; (Wikipedia).</p>
<p>The explanation for this is that a nation with natural resources has an easily
monopolizable source of power: the resource itself. Natural Resources are
physical things. They can be walled off, extracted in mass, and monopolized.
This presents a ready-made roadway to concentrating power. By contrast, a nation
poor in resources does not have that easy route for concentrated power, and is
more inclined to sharing it.</p>
<h1>Race and The Wheel of Political Markets</h1>
<p>So this essay started in my mind because I basically gave a friend from France
an overview of the evolution of the American Party System from 1860 to the
present day. I believe here I am walking out onto thin ice, but I am not going
to let that deter me from laying out my understanding of the world.</p>
<p>How correct that overview was is largely irrelevant. The shape is correct. I'm
going to repeat it now.</p>
<p>I think the American party system is a lot like a giant wheel of shifting
political constituencies and party elites trying their damndest to win elections
by picking off the edges of their opponent. Here's how I see the history of the
United States since 1860:</p>
<p>In the Civil War the parties were pretty well-delineated. The South was held by
the Democrats, a white-identity based party of rural poor and landed
aristocrats. They were very <term>closed</term>. The North was held by the
Republicans, a loose collection of abolitionists and liberals. They were very
&quot;Whiggish&quot; in the sense of liberal technocrats. Woke Capitalists, if you will.
They were very <term>open</term>.</p>
<p>We can say, at this point, that the central spoke, or axis, of our political
wheel was race.</p>
<p>During the war, the commercial interests in the North became very rich, and very
Republican. After the war, these commercial interests, being the alimentary
canal of society, couldn't give less of a shit about the interests of poor
blacks in the poor south. Reconstruction lasted a little under 15 years, while
the liberals in the Republican party held onto their power, but gradually, the
commercial, business coalition of the Republican party successfully wrested
power from them and the Republicans ceased to care about racial equality. It was
better for business.</p>
<p>History is never linear, so we saw some anti-business action from the Republican
party over the ensuing decades, like Teddy Roosevelt's progressive trust
busting, but in general, the Republican party took its business coalition very
seriously.</p>
<p>Race, for a time, ceased to be a primary motivating factor in the politics of
the US. An apartheid was allowed to be reinstated in the Jim Crow South.</p>
<p>Come the 1930's, the US enters the Great Depression. Extreme poverty lays across
the land like a shroud. The Democratic Party, having always been more interested
in labor than the Republican Party due to its base in the poor, rural, south,
picks up the issue of class and labor as its primary platform. FDR, a [New York]
democrat, has 4 consecutive clean sweeps of the South.</p>
<p>Now, FDR was no racial egalitarian. There were quite a lot of racially
exclusionary policies during the New Deal. So, the central axis of our politics
at this point was class-based.</p>
<p>In the 1950's, we can say, definitively, that the Republican party still had
civil rights members: Dwight Eisenhower, a Republican, sent the 101st Airborne
into Little Rock to force desegregation, brought upon by a Supreme Court
decision lead by his own Republican nominee: Earl Warren. In fact, Earl Warren
is known almost universally as a distinctly liberal Justice <em>despite being a
Republican</em>. We can say, therefore, that the Republican party had liberal
members even into the 1950s. I don't know that we can call Eisenhower a strict
egalitarian, there's some evidence I've seen that he regretted having to send in
the military, but can we just take a moment and think about how awesome it is
that the same company that dropped behind enemy lines the night before D-Day
went into Arkansas to force desegregation?</p>
<p>In the 1960s, LBJ started to change the status quo by seeking a new political
market. LBJ was a notorious racist, but he must have seen political winds
changing because he pursued the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act
vehemently to passage. And with that the Democrats became the party of civil
rights.</p>
<p>So in the 1960s we have a new battle line drawing. It is the same one as in
1860, only inverted. There is a new unclaimed political market: racists.
Southern white segregationists. The Republican party never represented them, and
the Democratic party, having pushed the Civil Rights Act and Voting Rights Act,
is clearly abandoning this demographic in favor of a racially diverse labor
demographic.</p>
<p>So in 1968 we have riots, protests, and racial politics. What do the Republicans
do? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_strategy">Pick up that racist vote</a>. Thus began the Sixth Party System.</p>
<h1>Race as the Central Instinctual Political Axis</h1>
<p>If we accept openness and closedness as the central political axis, what is the
most essential political issue along this divide? It isn't economic freedom,
because we can see conservatives supporting economic freedom in the US, and
liberals supporting it in China. It isn't environmental issues, as the basis of
environmentalism is, <em>itself</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_conservatism">conservation</a>. It isn't democracy, either,
because there have been plenty of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoconservatism">conservatives who have been strong champions
of democracy</a>.</p>
<p>No, the central central political issue in instinctual politics, universal
across cultures, is <em>race</em>.</p>
<p>Racists are <em>always</em> conservative. They do not want to accept another group of
people as themselves. Because strangeness, otherness, is uncertain. Is change.</p>
<p>This is what I meant by saying our political parties are not <em>instinctually</em>
political like we are. Our parties are actually <em>rarely</em> divided upon the race
axis. And when they are, we have mass eruptions of political turmoil.</p>
<!--# The Gray Matter of Political Identity-->
<h1>Risk, Uncertainty, and Aversion to Change</h1>
<p>I think that there's more to the world than I've already discussed and I want to
lay a little groundwork for how I expect I'll think in the future.</p>
<p>First, I want to talk in another essay about what I call &quot;The Gray Matter of
Political Identity&quot; and how people don't have distinct positions until they're
forced to choose. This dovetails with polarization and some stuff Gene Sharp
writes about during the commencement of any mass action. I'd also like to talk
about the American State Religion. Yes, it exists. But for now I'll talk a bit
about how I expect my thinking on what I've talked about to evolve.</p>
<p>I have heretofore described the centrality of change to politics, but really
it's more than that: it's uncertainty. Fear of change is fear of uncertainty.
Fear of others is fear of uncertainty. Fear itself is uncertainty.</p>
<p>Let's examine this.</p>
<p>There's this one-off fact I read in a Time Magazine cover article titled <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200220224509/http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2146449-3,00.html">&quot;The
Pursuit of Happiness&quot;</a> once that has shaped a lot of my thinking about all
of this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...that idea got a big boost when investigators at Harvard and Boston
University analyzed a gene dubbed DRD4, which is associated with activity in
the brain's dopamine receptors. The gene comes in several forms, or alleles.
Of the three most common, one codes for even-temperedness and reflection,
while the other two code for exploratory and impulsive behavior, as well as a
taste for risk taking and a tolerance of novelty.</p>
<p>When the investigators looked at the frequency of the different alleles in
people around the world, they found that the farther along the migration route
from Africa, the cradle of us all, through central Asia, Europe and the New
World, the likelier people were to carry the two novelty-seeking alleles.
Studies of another gene called 5-HTTLPR, related to serotonin transport, have
yielded similar findings. The allele of that gene that codes for anxiety and
risk avoidance is less common in individualistic cultures like that of the
U.S.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If we think about this: not only is risk-taking selected for in the America by
it's being at nearly the end of prehistoric migration routes (across the Bering
Strait), but during the mass waves of immigration in the 19th century you <em>had</em>
to be novelty-seeking to risk a months-long journey to a land you'd never seen
to start a new life. And if we examine this gene, this novelty-seeking gene, <a href="https://healthland.time.com/2010/10/28/never-mind-the-tea-party-can-a-liberal-gene-make-you-a-party-animal/">we
can easily match it up with the liberal instinct</a>.</p>
<p>There's this idea that the United States is conservative. This is bullshit. I'm
going to quote my Negroni article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>America is literally the most liberal country in the world. Here in America we
often think of Europe as far more sophisticated and liberal than the US. But
it's really not, in a lot of ways. The US may not have the most generous
welfare system, but hell, we're the only country in the world to give out one
time stimulus payments during the pandemic. We're the most diverse country in
the world, and when people think we're the most racist, they aren't accounting
for the fact that that diversity allows racism to show it's face, where other
countries don't have the opportunity to show racism like we do (ever heard of
Black Pete?). First hand accounts of France I've read describe their racial
attitudes as being close to America in the 80's. Concepts like
Intersectionalism are foreign to their general populace, and the idea of Color
Blindness is still pretty standard. Hell, even the liberals in England (J.K.
Rowling...) are incredibly transphobic. The French are very Islamophobic, far
more Islamophobic than the average American. The Germans, fuck, holy shit are
they a mess. They don't even believe in debt! They call it &quot;schuld&quot;, a synonym
for &quot;shame.&quot; (If you don't understand the relevance of this, consider that the
concepts of financing and debt are the most liberal of inventions in history:
the idea that you can owe people money and it's a good thing, that the owing
someone money now will pay off in the future. It demands a belief in
progress.) Ronald Reagan, one of our <em>conservatives</em> <a href="https://nowthisnews.com/videos/politics/ronald-reagans-final-presidential-speech-was-for-immigrants">bragged in his final
address</a> about the fact that you can't become a Japanese, you can't become
a Frenchman, you can't become a German, but anyone can become an American.
This is a profoundly liberal idea. (Watch that speech, please, it's stunning,
from a man I do not love.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed, America is <em>so</em> liberal that our conservatives champion liberal
principles: free markets and individual liberty. In America we confused what the
world typically means by liberal and conservative. Liberal means free and
conservative means the status quo. In America, the status quo <em>is</em> freedom.</p>
<p>But examining this, it seems this American penchant for risk taking shows how
liberal America is. How inextricably linked liberalness and comfort with
uncertainty are.</p>
<p>I like to think the only great sin is a lack of curiosity. Of overconfidence.
Hubris.</p>
<p>Reactionaries fear uncertainty to such an extent that they assume supreme
confidence in the most basic of things that they know. They reject nuance, and
assume everything to be simple. They tend toward conspiracy theories because
they understand evil humans better than complex indeterminate systems. They
don't like nuance, they don't like impersonal forces.</p>
<p>Radicals are so overconfident in their reason that they assume, through reason
alone, they can find a societal structure which will be better than what has
evolved through nature.</p>
<p>Conservatives fear, and Liberals hope, and they're both right, to fear and hope.</p>
