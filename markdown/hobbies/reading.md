title: "Reading"
short: "ðŸ“–"

I love reading, but I can't always manage it. Sometimes my attention span gets
the better of me.

Lately I've been resetting by enjoying some guilty pleasures: science fiction. I
grew up reading scifi like there was nothing else. Sometimes, when I have
trouble reading, I just grab a scifi book to unwind and get back into the spirit
of things.

Recently I've read [Project Hail Mary by Andy Weir][0] (AMAZING) and [Sleeping
Giants by Sylvain Neuvel][1] (really pretty mediocre). I tried [The Three Body
Problem by Cixin Liu][2] and maybe I'll try again to finish it but it's just
nowhere near as good as [Obama said][3]. The ideas are cool, but it's just
really a chore to read.

Much more interestingly than all of that, I've been devouring the [Revelation
Space][4] trilogy. I finished the first 2 and am now starting the third.

I'm hoping to get back to some really good high-brow literature, the kind of
stuff that inspired anno.wiki, but I'll give it some time.
