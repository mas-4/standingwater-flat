I love cocktails. I used to love wine, but that gets boring because you just pay
for other people's work. Right now I'm sipping a Frenchie Negroni with an
orange wheel. It's just a Negroni spiked with a little St. Germain, but this is
what I love about cocktails: I just concoct stuff from base recipes and google
and there's a name for it. If there isn't, hey! I discovered a cocktail!

## Aztec Old Fashioned (a riff on the Oaxacan)
- 1¬Ω oz. El Tesor Reposado Tequila
- ¬Ω oz. Del Maguey Vida Mezcal
- 1 barspoon Agave Syrup
- 2 dashes Bittermens Xocolatl Bitters
- 1 dash Angostura
- 1 dash Lime Acid (94% water, 4% citric acid, 2% malic acid, 0.04% succinic
  acid)
- 1 dash Bittermens Habanero Shrub

Stir over ice, strain onto a large clear ice block, flame an orange peel on top,
and serve.

I really take all my hobbies to the nth degree. I've learned to make clear ice
per the [Camper English method][0], make [syrups like Death & Co. does it][1],
and use acids like [Dave Arnold][3]. I stir, shake, muddle, smoke, infuse, and
filter. The only thing I haven't gotten to try yet is liquid nitrogen.

I wrote a 5000 word essay on the [Negroni and Political Psychology if you're
interested][2].
