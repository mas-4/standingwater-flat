I like poetry. I'm not a poetry fanatic, I'm not a poet, I'm not even a writer,
I just like poetry.

Good poetry

<div class="poetry">
<p>1
<p>Upon the black hole Cygnus X-1 that wobbles
<p>as if boffed by an invisible companion,
<p>upon a silk stocking the color of bees
<p>rolling itself up down a leg, upon the soft dip
<p>over the clavicles, which accept only tongued kisses,
<p>upon the tongue that slowly drifts
<p>into the other’s mouth and chats
<p>there with her opposite number,
<p>gravity exerts the precise force needed.
<p><br></p>
<p>2
<p>In the wings of the Eskimo curlew
<p>flapping through the thin air of the Andes,
<p>in the sacral vertebrae of the widow
<p>who stoops at the window to peer
<p>behind the drawn blind, in the saggy skin
<p>under the eyes of the woman
<p>who is in love with a man incapable
<p>of love, who lives on in the heaviness
<p>of emotional isolation, in the lavish
<p>cascade of urine the rhino releases,
<p>in the mouthwater of the child who waits
<p>in shriek position for the dentist,
<p>in the scradged skin dangling in shreds
<p>from the children who lurched toward
<p>the Nakashima River screaming, as if this were
<p>the single aria they had ever rehearsed, gravity
<p>shudders at its mathematical immensity.
<p><br></p>
<p>3
<p>As long as two kvetches remain alive,
<p>because inside each is self-hatred so hardened
<p>not even nonexistence can abide them,
<p>as long as the hummingbird strikes
<p>the air seventy-four times per second,
<p>as long as the mound of earth remains heaped
<p>beside the rectangular hole waiting to be filled,
<p>gravity cannot be said to impose its will.
<p><br></p>
<p>4
<p>If the pilot ejects one second too late,
<p>if the condemned man shrinks at seeing
<p>the trapdoor give way, if the man who stands
<p>with fire at his back and a baby in his arms
<p>hears the near neighbors cry,
<p>“Drop her! Don’t worry! We’ll catch her,”
<p>if the juggler gets behind in her count
<p>and the bright object flies past the spot
<p>where the other hand was to snatch it,
<p>gravity cannot pause to rectify matters.
<p><br></p>
<p>5
<p>When a deer kenning us stands immobile,
<p>and for one moment we know we exist
<p>entirely within her thoughts, when cichlid fry,
<p>sensing danger, empty their air bladders
<p>and drop to the river bottom like pebbles,
<p>when the snow goes and millions of leaves
<p>reveal themselves pressed down over the contours
<p>of earth to create her hibernation mask,
<p>when a person in a military cemetery
<p>among grave markers that spread to all the horizons
<p>understands that all of existence has been destroyed
<p>again and again, when depression after mania
<p>causes clock hands to stick and days to crawl,
<p>when the full moon’s light creeps across a sleeper
<p>calling to her atavistic soul, when a soldier,
<p>who has always known life is imperfect,
<p>is wheeled to another hopeless attempt
<p>at surgery—but, this time, resolves
<p>to sleep and not wake again until such time
<p>as time begins again—then gravity
<p>grips us to the earth, and crosses its fingers.
<p><br></p>
<p>6
<p>In the case of the last ancient trees at Ypres
<p>still turning out their terrified wood,
<p>in the case of the concertina wire
<p>hurled out in exuberant spirals and set down
<p>between rich and poor, in the case of the howls
<p>that fly off the earth through madhouse windows,
<p>in the case of the word “heavenly”
<p>when we remind ourselves that earth,
<p>too, was a heavenly body once,
<p>in the case of the numeral keys
<p>totting up the number of humans
<p>humans have killed, in the case of the man
<p>who strays into a gravitational field where
<p>the differential between the force on the scalp
<p>and the force on the foot sole will stretch him
<p>into an alimentary canal thin as a thread,
<p>in the case of the child who has upset
<p>his ink bottle while doing homework
<p>and quickly snaps both arms down
<p>to halt the lateral gush of the black juices,
<p>gravity, if it could, would recuse itself.

On First Looking into Chapman's Homer By John Keats

<div class="poetry">
<p>Much have I travell'd in the realms of gold,
<p>And many goodly states and kingdoms seen;
<p>Round many western islands have I been
<p>Which bards in fealty to Apollo hold.
<p>Oft of one wide expanse had I been told
<p>That deep-brow'd Homer ruled as his demesne;
<p>Yet did I never breathe its pure serene
<p>Till I heard Chapman speak out loud and bold:
<p>Then felt I like some watcher of the skies
<p>When a new planet swims into his ken;
<p>Or like stout Cortez when with eagle eyes
<p>He star'd at the Pacific—and all his men
<p>Look'd at each other with a wild surmise—
<p>Silent, upon a peak in Darien.

<div class="poetry">
<p>When I Heard the Learn’d Astronomer
<p>By Walt Whitman
<p>When I heard the learn’d astronomer,
<p>When the proofs, the figures, were ranged in columns before me,
<p>When I was shown the charts and diagrams, to add, divide, and measure them,
<p>When I sitting heard the astronomer where he lectured with much applause in the lecture-room,
<p>How soon unaccountable I became tired and sick,
<p>Till rising and gliding out I wander’d off by myself,
<p>In the mystical moist night-air, and from time to time,
<p>Look’d up in perfect silence at the stars.

Absalom, Absalom!

<div class="poetry">
<p>I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving hysterical naked,
<p>dragging themselves through the negro streets at dawn looking for an angry fix,
<p>angelheaded hipsters burning for the ancient heavenly connection to the starry dynamo in the machinery of night,
<p>who poverty and tatters and hollow-eyed and high sat up smoking in the supernatural darkness of cold-water flats floating across the tops of cities contemplating jazz,
<p>who bared their brains to Heaven under the El and saw Mohammedan angels staggering on tenement roofs illuminated,
