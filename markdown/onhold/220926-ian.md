So! A hurricane is a-comin'.

Been some years (5 to be exact, and because of hurricane season, I mean it
exactly. It was 2 weeks and 5 years ago ago today, September 12, 2017).

Ironically, [Irma][irma] was exactly 57 years after [Hurricane Donna][donna], and
followed _exactly_ the same path.

It's supposed to reach us tomorrow night, I just finished a day of work and
frantically putting outdoor potential debris away. Only halfish done (probably
less).

Gonna work tomorrow, and put more potential debris away.

We're not planning on evacuating, or boarding. We've gone through this before
and boarding is a _bitch_ for us, but luckily, the wind will be from the south
this time instead of the north, and our south side is more protected.

Anyway, I'm stocking up on deep learning documentation to keep working on my new
[bslearn][bslearn] project, a neural net in C. Won't have internet access, so
documentation and books are important. I have a Macbook Air M2 and it has insane
battery life so I should be good on that front.
