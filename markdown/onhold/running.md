title: "Running"
short: "ðŸ‘Ÿ"

I love running. Or, rather, I love running when I can. Lately I haven't been so
lucky. I've been commuting and it's hard to find the time.

There's no much to say here. Anytime I feel extreme anxiety I go for a run and
it goes away. America has had big running crazes during times of crisis (9/11,
the 1960's, Coronavirus) and it seems obvious why: you have to do something when
you're feeling anxious, and running seems a good way to alleviate it.

Waking up early and going for a run before the sun's up, the deer looking up at
you wondering what you're doing, it's kind of magical.
