  <p>Hi ðŸ‘‹,</p>
  <p>
    I'm Michael Sendker. I'm a software developer from The Other Bay Area (Tampa
    Bay).
  </p>
  <p>
    I like programming, a lot. Sometimes I blog about it
    <a href="/posts.html">here</a>. I seem to post more often about philosophy
    and politics though. I'm trying to change that.
  </p>
  <p>
    I built this site using
    <a href="https://github.com/mas-4/bluesky">bluesky</a>, a static site
    generator I wrote myself in C++ and named after my dog, who passed not too
    long ago.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you want to know more about me, check my <a href="/about">about page</a>.
    If you want to see about hiring me, and my one man developer agency Standing
    Water LLC, please email me: m at standingwater dot io. (Hopefully you can
    read that email address, I use words instead of symbols to foil the bots
    ðŸ« ).
  </p>
