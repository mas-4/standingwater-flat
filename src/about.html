  <h1>Who I Am</h1>
  <p>
    I'm not a CS or EE or math or STEM grad, I majored in Philosophy. I also
    never went to a bootcamp. All of my development skills are self-cultivated
    because I really like programming.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am a problem solver. Not a mathematician or a computer scientist. My
    career until now has consisted of solving problems quickly and efficiently,
    from technology issues to inefficient algorithms. I have built static sites
    in GatsbyJS, interfaces in WPF, and web scrapers in Python. I've written
    data readers in C and system code in C++. I've worked on Machine Learning
    systems, web applications, and testing tools. I once built an arduino-based
    PID controller for a popcorn popper to roast my own coffee before every
    trying C++ or embedded programming.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am an "expert" in Python, though that term rubs me the wrong way. I am
    proficient in C and JavaScript, learning C++, and have written code in C#,
    Scheme, and Bash. I am familiar with Scikit-Learn, Flask, ReactJS, and
    SQLAlchemy. I once started working on a project written in a language I'd
    never dealt with (C#), using an IDE I'd never opened (Visual Studio), and a
    paradigm I'd never tried my hand at (desktop applications), and was building
    new modules within a fortnight. In the paraphrased words of one of my
    managers, I may not be able to write the most efficient fast fourier
    transform, but I can probably figure out a technical solution for a given
    problem faster than the next guy.
  </p>
  <p>
    All of this should also demonstrate that I am a full time learner. I have
    spent enough time learning new things that I have full confidence in my
    ability to learn new things. But most of all, I am a thoughtful programmer.
    I think twice about abstraction or hard coding, I think about tech debt and
    the way users will interact with a feature. I question whether the most
    expedient-path is what's called for, or whether it will lead to more pain
    down the road. When I'm writing code in the present, I'm thinking about the
    future.
  </p>
  <p>
    As for my personal life, I'm omnivorous in my interests. Whether it be
    mastering espresso, mixing acidic solutions for the perfect cocktail, caring
    for sick orchids, or learning another language to appreciate a particular
    cinema culture, I bring the same level of technical excellence to everything
    I do.
