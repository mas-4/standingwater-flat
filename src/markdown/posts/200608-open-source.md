# On Standardization

One of the fundamental things in this world that I believe in, something that I
believe stimulates growth above and beyond nearly anything else government or
society can do, is _standardization_. We might also call it platformization. The
basic idea I'm driving at is that what stimulates growth in any realm is for
there to be a commons: whether it be a standard specification or a standard
platform.

To explain specifications, think of those for the plugs in our walls, the parts
in our computer, or even the typesetting of books. This last one is not an
officially recognized specification, but books absolutely do follow some general
guidelines, and you'd better have a good reason to break them—specification #1:
you'd better have a damn good reason to print your title backwards on the spine
(being in Europe is, for example, a damn good reason).

Some very significant platforms I can think of: the highway system, the
electrical grid, even the financial markets. We might call the last one an
institution. (Institutions are essentially social platforms that become so
ingrained in a culture that the culture builds upon it.)

Standardization allows for competition and innovation within a marketplace. It's
what propels an economy forward. The highway system and the electrical grid are
a common example. They're platforms that the government had to build _itself_
because no private entity would ever commit the funds necessary to build it.
And yet, once it was built, _EVERYONE_ benefited, especially industry.

This is a common Democratic refrain; Obama essentially said this exact thing in
his "you didn't build that" speech that the Republicans misquoted and exploited.
The Libertarian loves to think that only private initiative is worth
celebrating, or even allowing; he never has a satisfactory answer to the
Democrat who asks "what about roads?"—or clean water, electricity, etc.

Here's a common Libertarian argument (perhaps more accurately described as
Objectivist):

1. The natural order has an equilibrium.
2. When humans muck about with a natural order, dictating things from the top
   down, the equilibrium is disrupted.
3. The economy is a natural order.
4. Therefore, the economy should not be mucked about with.

Here's the problem with this sentiment: it presupposes that the economic natural
order excludes governmental intervention. This presupposition is based on a
deeper presupposition: that government _itself_ is not natural.

We can disprove this very simply: since mankind transitioned from the hunter
gatherer stage, we have had governments. As a peculiarly social creature, with
an incredible capacity for adaptation above, beyond, and even in direct conflict
with, our genetically-predisposed behaviors, government is an integral structure
in human society and culture.

My point, in ragging on this Libertarian line of thought is that
_standardization_ is the perfect example of a necessary function government
serves in the economy. [Jaron Lanier][20] in his fantastic book _[Who Owns the Future?][0]_
makes an excellent case for this. A standardized platform allows people to
compete in a way they can't when the platform _itself_ is trying to compete with
them.

Specifically think of the highway system. There are tolls, yes, but just to keep
the roads in good repair. If a private organization owned the highway system,
businesses would have to factor the cost of tolls into the price of their goods
in a way they don't now. The road owners would probably start their own
transportation company, exploit their position as road-owners, and dominate the
transportation market as well. The tolls would be exorbitant for everyone else,
unlike reality now, where the transportation industry is very competitive. The
transfer of wealth to commerce in artificially low tolls is enormous and has
fueled much growth in the twentieth century (beside that fueled by advancements
in technology, globalization, etc.).

Now consider Google. It's a platform, and a fairly standard one. Amazon is, too.
By standard I mean that it's a platform (product, specification, etc.) used by
the majority (if not super-majority) of people in the economy. We're living in a
strange time in that, where in the past standards generally had to be built (or
at least heavily subsidized) by governments (think railroads, electical grid,
highway system, USPS), standards now are being built by private organizations.
This is because of the nature of software: it does not require an incredible
amount of capital and labor to build a software product that can be used by the
majority of people; it just requires good design. The FAANGs are absolutely
integral to the economy at this point, and at least three of them started in
garages. Which is awesome, because clearly the affordability of innovation is
producing incredible growth in the economy, right?

The problem is that the FAANGs are all profit-seeking entities. They are not
concerned with building the best product, only the _most profitable_ product.
Because of that, they don't allow competition with their platform _on_ their
platform, and they feel entitled to compete on their platform with those
utilizing their platform.

What the heck do I mean by that?

Take Google Play. The Google Play Store is a package repository for Android from
which we get all of our applications on our Android phones. The package
repository idea is fantastic, I love it; it is generally a lot more efficient
and easy to use than the Windows model of downloading `.exe`'s and going to
various websites to get updates.

But here's the issue: Google does not allow any competition _with_ the Google
Play Store—that is, you cannot include in the Google Store an “app store app”
(see [F-Droid][1])—and Google reserves full rights to compete with people using
its Store—for an example see Google Lens, distributed through the Play Store,
which directly competes with the hundreds of QR Code Scanners listed in the
store.

Amazon does this too: a company like Overstock.com can't exploit Amazon's
marketplace to leverage their own marketplace (though it's difficult to imagine
how they would; also: they do sell gift cards on Amazon), and Amazon is
increasingly in competition with its Amazon Marketplace users (see, for
instance, [Amazon Basics][2]).

These aren't the only reason proprietary standard platforms are bad. A bigger
example is Microsoft Windows. While Windows may not be the dominant OS anymore
(that belongs to Linux via Android, though the technical validity of that
dominance is debatable—about the only things Linux truly dominates are servers
and supercomputers) it does still dominate the desktop PC market. Windows, I can
assure you, through my daily use, is a shithole. It literally [breaks itself
through updates all the time][3]. What's worse is that Windows obfuscates and
hides its internals from its users, which prevents those users from finding easy
help to fix it. Linux, by contrast [frequently breaks due to user error, but you
can easily find help fixing it][4] (linked is a question literally asked today
and fixed, as well, on unix.se).

# Free and Open-Source Software

Now that I've mentioned Linux, I think it's time I explain how all this talk
about standardization applies to FOSS.

Linux is a _FOSS_ standard platform, in contrast to the proprietary standard
platforms already mentioned. No, Linux is not a standard for desktop pc end
users. It is a standard for serious computing: [it is used as a server by
nearly every company in the world][5]. This is because, unlike Windows, when it
breaks _you generally don't have to reinstall it_. Furthermore, _it rarely
breaks itself_. Even Arch Linux, contrary to the memes, rarely breaks. But the
real key to Linux's dominance are twofold:

1. It is maintained by a community of people who recognize that its users build
   serious applications with it and require it to be rock solid and
   standardized (it mostly follows the [Linux Standard Base][16] standard, which
   is mostly a superset of [POSIX][17]; yes, I pulled this from a [stackoverflow
   question][18]).
2. If the standardized nature of its system isn't good enough for you, _it lets
   you do with it as you will_.

Libertarians will claim to score a point on #1: the standardization of Linux
(through the [lineage of Unix][6]) was built up through a lengthy history of
undirected evolution. Programmers used Unix, so programmers built Unix up. As
they did they created a large ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that is
standardized and well-documented. The boon to the software economy that this has
produced is immeasurable. But they would be sorely mistaken, because this
paragraph has neglected one simple fact: Unix was born in a [skunkworks lab][21]
owned by a [government-sanctioned monopoly][22].

Now take Git. We can leave Linux behind, since everyone knows how great the
Linux success story is. But Git never ceases to amaze me. Linus Torvalds hacked
it together over the course of two or so months in 2005 with the help of [Junio
Hamano][7] when the proprietary system they'd been using (BitKeeper) pulled
their permission. It has since become a Standard FOSS Platform. We can perhaps,
rather, use the word **_tool_**. Git is a Standard FOSS Tool. And it is a miracle
tool. To quote [Sinclair Target][8]:

> While people sometimes grouse about its steep learning curve or unintuitive
> interface, Git has become everyone's go-to for version control. In Stack
> Overflow's 2015 developer survey, 69.3% of respondents used Git, almost twice
> as many as used the second-most-popular version control system, Subversion.

Git has assumed this level of dominance for several reasons:

1. It is ingeniously designed, representing a major leap over the previous
   bazaar of version control software: you can see this by reading from [the
   profusion of old timers saying it][9].
2. _IT IS FOSS_.

The fact that it is FOSS is key. It is because of the governance nature of FOSS
projects that developers _trust_ it. It will not release broken updates, it will
not start stuffing your repository with ads, and it will not incorporate
money-grabbing features. It's sole purpose is to help you do your job, and be
good at it.

Of course, there are bad FOSS projects, which is why it's generally better to
use a FOSS project that's big.

What's fantastic about the position of Git, not just for its maintainers, but
for all of us, is that by having a large, standardized, and open source tool,
people can do ingenious things with it that they wouldn't with a proprietary
tool. Take the latest interesting use of Git I've found: [`pass`][10]. I just
set it up the other day and was forced to learn how to use (yet another standard
FOSS tool) `gpg`.

-- around here I need to acknowledge the way that most FOSS is charitable and
why it exists in a free market --

I have fallen in love with FOSS software because of this quality: it may not be
the easiest stuff to use, but I can trust it, practically with my life, because
it is maintained by dedicated volunteers who care about it not breaking
anybody's work, supported by a plethora of developers who use it [and thus can
help other developers who use it][11], and because it allows its users to do
some pretty interesting things with it.

Some of my Standard FOSS Tools right now:

- Linux (in the form of Arch Linux)
- Vi (in the form of Neovim)
- Git
- Python
- MySQL (in the form of MariaDB)

I have literally added in the past three days GnuPG (an implementation of the
PGP standard) to this toolchain.

Even Markdown, the format I'm writing this in, which is far from _standardized_,
though it is a standard, amazes me with its utility. (It is an open
specification, but it is not maintained except in a bazaar of implementations,
as John Gruber seems to prefer.)

There is something absolutely amazing about the age, pedigree, and commonality
of these tools. Notice I said pedigree. Many of these tools have such storied
histories, have had so many thousands of programmers hacking away at them, some
of them being lovingly reimplemented so many times, that they have accreted
incredible utility. Let me quote a bit from Neal Stephenson's extended essay
[_In the Beginning... Was the Command Line_][19]:

This is why FOSS is high culture. To quote [Wikipedia][23], another FOSS project:

> High culture encompasses the cultural objects of aesthetic value, which a
> society collectively esteem as exemplary art. It may also include intellectual
> works considered to be of supreme philosophical, historical, or literary
> value, as well as the education which cultivates such aesthetic and
> intellectual pursuits.

Can anyone possibly say that what Stephenson just described is not a cultural
product of exemplary value? If we take software as art—which we easily could,
given the aesthetic value applied to code by hackers everywhere—_then FOSS
is High Culture_. And this is why I love FOSS.

# Incentive Structures

Why does FOSS exist? This might be the biggest question. I mean, sure, like I've
said, government or monopoly investment can easily produce good standards (Bell
Labs, the US Highway System), but the Libertarians are actually right on this
one. It is mostly individuals acting on their own that produce good standards.
Not always, of course, but git is a great example of a group of individuals who
produce an incredible product and let it be free.

We can see quite clearly, almost deductively, that once a project is FOSSed it
is FOSS for good. Counter examples exist, like MySQL: it was purchased by
Oracle and the original developer decided to fork it. Once software is free,
it's free practically always.

"Software is a sucker's game," says Neal Stephenson. It makes sense. Software,
like information, wants to be free. Once it's leaked, it's impossible to get
back in the pipe. If software is open source and good, other people will use it.
Once enough people use it, if the original BDFL (Benevolent Dictator For Life)
gets bored of it and stops maintaining it, if the software is important enough
someone will take over the project.

So the real question is why does FOSS start? It seems for a variety of reasons.
Many programming languages are born out of skunkworks: Go, Rust, C, Erlang.
Other projects are developed in research institutions: Scala, the World Wide
Web. Some are literally developed by companies to facilitate their work:
ReactJS, Hack, AngularJS. Some are developed for personal use: PHP, Linux. And
others are written just because the writer can. Some time this week I want to
write a script to text someone according to a slowly accelerating frequency that
they need to register to vote before the deadline. Perhaps that's a noble,
altruistic goal. To my mind, there's three reasons to write it:

1. It gets a friend to vote, who otherwise wouldn't (alturistic).
2. It can be open sourced for other people to get their friends to vote, which
   may improve the chances of my preferred political party from winning
   (altruistic and self-interested).
3. I can open source it and showcase it in my résumé as a piece of cool open
   source software that shows I'm both clever and altruistic (purely
   self-interested).

So there's a plethora of reasons for FOSS to be created. Not all of it requires
government intervention. Perhaps none of it does. But some software exists, that
is standardized, and not open source. And it sucks.

# The Crappiness of Proprietary Solutions

When I was setting up `pass` recently I generated two `gpg` keys as well. In the
process, I learned quite a lot.

One of the things I looked into was how to protect my keys. If I lose them, I
lose access to all the passwords I have encrypted and stored in `pass` using
them. So I ended up finding [this suggestion on security.se to print them as QR
codes][13]. After I generated these codes, I had to test them by reading them
back into my phone. From there I left the realm of beautiful open source
software to the hellscape that is proprietary software.

As I've already mentioned, I'm a sucker for standards. I have an Android phone,
and since I'm not a fan of installing excessive amounts of software (I am a
pretty vicious bloat-remover) I decided to use a pre-installed Google package
to scan the QR code: Google Lens.

Except, Google Lens doesn't think you'll use the QR scanner for anything except
a Google search. When I scanned my key's QR code, there was no option to copy
the text to a clipboard. So I had to go looking for something else and settled
on Trend Micro's QR code scanner after looking through the Play Store for a
while and seeing nothing but the general crap on offer there: ad-bloated
mediocre pieces of software written in 10 days and rarely updated so the author
can generate passive revenue. Then, I had to paste the text from the scan into a
text editor so I could combine it (I had had to split my key across several QR
codes because it was too much data). So I had to find a text editor. The same
problem was presented as before: there aren't any good text editors for the
phone. I settled on QuickEdit which had too many ads.

In the end it worked, but I was struck by how shitty the experience of getting
it into my phone was in contrast to creating it. There were no standard FOSS
tools on the Android Play store. Why? How is it that no one has made a decent
FOSS QR Scanner, or that Google hasn't just built one into the phone yet? How is
it that there isn't a built in text editor? Even Microsoft's Notepad would
serve!

This is why proprietary standards suck. F-Droid has multiple QR Code scanners
and multiple text editors that all look pretty respectable. Why does nothing
like these exist on Google Play?

Similar problems have presented themselves to me on Amazon. Search for a quality
copy of [_Winesburg, Ohio_ by Sherwood Anderson][14] and see if you can find
one. All I've found are, like the plethora of crappy apps on the Google Play
Store, badly-formatted copies of a public domain book generated in 10 minutes
by people exploiting Amazon's CreateSpace platform to generate passive income
with minimal work.

There are competitors to these platforms, but it's really a joke to expect them
to ever compete. [Mastadon][15] is awesome, but I'm not sure I see it ever
taking down Twitter (we can argue that Donald Trump's use of Twitter alone has
already made Twitter a target of nationalization). There are no real FOSS
competitors to Facebook. DuckDuckGo might be a legitimate competitor to Google,
but it's a legitimate competitor only in the sense that Linux was a legitimate
competitor to Microsoft in the mid-2000's: that is to say, not really, only for
power users and geeks.

Why is this? I would actually really like to understand why some services lend
themselves to privatization and others to FOSS. I suppose it's a matter of
costs: Amazon, Facebook, and Twitter all have to pay for server space, where
Linux really doesn't. But why is it that _within_ these platforms FOSS doesn't
thrive? GitHub is a proprietary service built on an open source service and
teems with open source (perhaps this is just because it's devoted to it?).
I literally cannot answer this question. There's probably a dozen answers in my
head and I can't settle on one.

All I'll say is this: if a private platform becomes so essential to society that
it cannot be eliminated without causing serious economic problems, and yet,
through profit-hungry motives proceeds to degrade its own product, _it must be
institutionalized_. It must be _standardized_. Of the FAANGs, several, in
particular Google, Amazon, and Facebook, are nearing the point where their
continuous degradation is becoming so grave a problem that it will soon be time
to nationalize them. Or at the very least regulate them as heavily as we once
regulated Ma Bell.

Don't even get me started on the telecoms.
