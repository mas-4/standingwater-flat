At the outset I want to inform the reader that this is not light reading. I'm
writing this to wrestle with my own fears and questions about the nature of
violence. I have witnessed and experienced a certain amount of it, in real life,
and it has stuck with me and forced me to grapple with these questions all my
life. As such this essay discusses topics of an extremely distressing nature,
and if you have had experiences with violence this essay may bother you.

Trigger warnings, like political correctness, are not an act of cowardice but of
courtesy. I want to be courteous to my reader, and not surprise them by
discussing things they may not want to read about.

# Why?

I'm feeling very philosophical today, and I don't have an answer, and this is
pretty meditative as I research.

This is actually a question I've wrestled with a long time. Kind of a cloud of
questions, really.

The thoughts are clouding me again because of a thread I read on Hacker News
about [The Girl in the Kent State Photo][0]. I didn't read the article, and
barely skimmed the comments, but the linked comment thread re-iterated a
consistent theme in my understanding of life and humanity.

This isn't *just* an American phenomenon, and anyone who thinks it is has a
really tunnel vision understanding of humanity and history. Celebration of pain
is a universal phenomenon in human society.

(***NB:*** I do not mean universal to all humans, but present in every human
society.)

There's a word for this that I think is too weak: Schadenfreude. 

> Schadenfreude (/ˈʃɑːdənfrɔɪdə/; German: [ˈʃaːdn̩ˌfʁɔʏ̯də]; lit. 'harm-joy') is
> the experience of pleasure, joy, or self-satisfaction that comes from learning
> of or witnessing the troubles, failures, or humiliation of another. 

Fascinatingly, the second sentence in the opening of [this Wikipedia][1]
(accessed 4/24/21) firmly establishes this as a human instinct, and not a
learned behavior:

> Schadenfreude is a complex emotion where, rather than feeling sympathy, one
> takes pleasure from watching someone's misfortune. This emotion is displayed
> more in children than adults. However, adults also experience schadenfreude,
> although generally they conceal it.

This concept is too weak, though, because Schadenfreude is really more about
misfortune than pain. There's no "See also" link on this page that describes the
celebration of someone else's *pain specifically*, which is rather unfortunate
because I'm having trouble finding a jumping off point to investigate why humans
celebrate the deaths of other human beings.

My puzzle is this: we are told, quite often, that normal human beings feel
empathy. They do not want to hurt others, they feel bad when they see others in
pain. Yet, at the same time, we frequently see absolutely vicious, bloodthirsty
behavior in normal, average people. I'm not talking about celebration of the
death of someone evil. I think everyone would celebrate Hitler's death, and
people certainly celebrated Osama Bin Laden's death. But what made the West
Point students celebrate the deaths of Kent State students?

Certainly those students did not do something worth killing for. It is
universally accepted that Kent State was a tragedy. Yet those West Pointers
celebrated their deaths. Why? Are they psychopaths?

# What is violence?
This might seem tangential, but is still a pretty strong question for me, and I
think it's essential to understand why someone would celebrate it.

We can describe violence as the inducement of pain, but this misses some
violence, and includes violence I would not include. Namely,

1. Included is small amounts of pain (easily eliminated through adding the
   addendum "beyond a threshold") and pain induced out of kindness: namely,
   medical interventions. We know that medical practitioners seek to eliminate
   as much pain as they can from the intervention through anesthesia, but this
   is not always possible, and we wouldn't say the practitioner is doing
   violence to the patient even if anesthesia is impossible. We might say that
   the surgeons amputating soldier's limbs in the Civil War to prevent gangrene
   were butchers, and that it was "violent", but we do recognize that it was
   voluntarily submitted to and clearly a life-saving intervention. This is not
   violence. We speak colloquially when we call it violent. But it is not what
   we mean by violence.
2. Excluded is non-personal violence. That is, to say, for instance, a violent
   car crash, or a building demolition, a "violent collision of matter". These
   seem to me to be violent.

Actually, upon writing numbers 1 and 2 I believe I've found I hold a
contradictory definition of violence. Let's redefine two non-exclusive violence
paradigms:

1. Psychological Violence: the experience by an individual of the sensation of
   pain.
2. Material Violence: a rapid destructive change in the condition, state, or
   composition of matter.

These overlap to some degree. Material violence can cause psychological
violence, and psychological violence can result in material violence. Material
violence can *be* psychological violence. Initially I had termed these Personal
Violence and Ontological Violence. Ontological Violence is clearly wrong because
Ontological is Being. Material is the right term. But Personal might be more apt
than Psychological. It was later in this essay I decided to change it. I'm still
not sure this is the correct choice.

But this distinction seems pretty satisfying to me. A stabbing is material and
psychological violence. An insult (or bullying) is exclusively psychological
violence (though we can say that it may lead to material violence: through
suicide). A car crash with test dummies is exclusively material violence.

# The Psychological Material Interchange

What translates an act of Material Violence into an act of Psychological
Violence *is* itself a question of state of mind and circumstances.

I keep trying to be open-ended, expecting not to be able to answer my own
questions. This essay is not to answer my questions but to get a better grasp of
the shape of the questions, but I'm finding it more and more easy to actually
answer the questions and it seems almost anti-climactic to me.

It seems clear that what makes material violence cross over into psychological
violence is actually pretty simple and relies on two conditions:

1. The material violence is against a person in such a way that causes
   lasting harm to the victim.
2. The victim is in a mindset such that they experience the harm as pain.

There are a lot of gotchas in these conditions and I'd like to explore them.

First, the definition of "lasting harm" is very important. As pain is not merely
physical, but also psychological, we can recognize that even acts which do not
cause material violence in a way that results in a permanently altered bodily
condition can qualify. Two such examples worth exploring: 

## 1. Rape

The act of rape does not have to result in physical violence. A friend of mine
was raped, but she experienced no physical violence. She was *threatened* with
it. This is *clearly* rape, but we can easily distinguish between a man
physically holding down and striking a woman to force her submission and
threatening her with material violence such that she submits. In the former,
there might be long-lasting bodily harm in the form of broken bones, a
concussion, bruising, physical scarring, etc. In the latter, the lasting harm is
psychological. I cannot believe that this is no less material violent simply
because there is no physical change of state. Let's explore why. Let's focus on
rape induced by threat of violence.

As an aside: I'm trying not to speak overly clinically about rape but I'm doing
a bad job of it.

The simple threat of violence can certainly induce long-lasting psychological
damage. And I see this as non-material, exclusively psychological violence.
There is no physical change of state in this case whatsoever. But if the threat
of violence induces a person to undergo an extremely distressing act: the act of
sex, we can see a *much more severe* effect of long-lasting psychological
damage. Why?

What is the difference in sensation between sex when one has consented and sex
when one has not consented? We have three events:

1. The threat of violence without the resulting non-consensual sex.
2. The threat of violence resulting in non-consensual sex.
3. Consensual sex.

Three separate experiences separated by one degree of condition. It's clear that
the difference between (1) and (2) is physical and the difference between (2)
and (3) is psychological. 

I believe this indicates that material-violence-induced pain results from a
combination of the psychological state of the victim and the nervous system. In
(1) the victim does not experience the change in state of their nervous system,
in (3) the victim experiences the same change of state of their nervous system
as (2) but does not have the psychological state to experience that nervous
sytem change as pain. Instead, they experience it as pleasure.

## 2. Psychological Torture

I'm going to try to copy a list of types of psychological torture ([Ojeda, What
is Psychological Torture?][8]):

> Categories of Psychological Torture
>
> Isolation: solitary or quasi-solitary confinement.
>
> Debilitation: food, water, and sleep deprivation; extreme temperatures.
>
> Spatiotemporal disorientation: confinement in small places, natural light
> denial.
>
> Sensory deprivation: hoods, goggles, gloves, deodorizing masks.
>
> Sensory assault: shouting, loud music, bright lights.
>
> Desperation: indefinite detention, sense of futility.
>
> Threats: of death or violence, to self or others, mock executions, witness
> torture.
>
> Degradation: verbal, nudity, personal hygiene denial, overcrowding, contact
> with pests, contact with excrement, sexual, ethnic, religious.
>
> Pharmacological manipulation: tranquilizers, hallucinogens.

This list bothers me. Because it's stunning how easy it is to torture a human
being. It also feels like my two well-defined paradigms of violence, material
and psychological, are actually less well-defined than I thought.

In our rape study I had seen the three different situations (about threat,
threat with rape, and sex) as belonging to 3 different categories of being:

1. Psychological
2. Psychological and material
3. Material

I'm making this up as I go to understand my thinking, so forgive me if this
doesn't make sense and seems surprising.

I *think* that I think that that psychological and material violence correlate to
two different types of events: psychological and material events. Psychological
events happen in the head, and material events happen in matter. There is
cross-over here, symmetrically, with these categories of violence: most
psychological events have some component of the material: to insult someone is
to create vibrations in the air. This is a material change, but it is not the
change of import: the change of import is the psychological change in the
person. You say "astronaut" and the vibrations in the air you produce reach my
ear and are interpreted by my brain to form the concept "astronaut". But no one
cares about the vibrations in the air, just the interchange of meaning for which
the vibrations serve as a conduit. We could be extremely pedantic and talk about
neuronal changes but I'd rather treat the brain as a black box for the purposes
of this essay.

Most of these forms of psychological torture do not involve a material change of
import. Putting a hood on someone is not a significant materially violent event.
But it is very profound. Disorientation is extremely distressing.  But I cannot
think of this as purely psychological violence. It is material cum
psychological. Why?

I believe it's because there is a physical experience. The physical experience
of having a hood put over one's head involves the nervous system.

This seems so arbitrary to me, though. Part of my philosophical method in
general is to recognize that categorization is useful, until it is not. There is
a resolution beyond which all categorization fails. So perhaps I can chalk that
arbitrariness up to this. I am exploring the concept beyond the resolution of my
categories already. They are now failing.

These categories I have created exist for a very specific reason: there is a
marked difference between an insult and a stabbing, and still further difference
between a stabbing and chopping down a tree. All three involve some level of
violence, and all three are categorically different. With my neat categories I
can say that the insult is psychological, the stabbing is psychological and
material, and the tree-chopping is strictly material.

But I think we have to accept that the utility of the categories is limited.

# Phenomenological Categories

I write these essays mostly for myself, but if they're read (at all) it will be
by non-professionals. I'll therefore explain some terms:

1. Ontology: the branch of metaphysics dealing with the nature of being.
2. Phenomenology: the science of phenomena as distinct from that of the nature
   of being. an approach that concentrates on the study of consciousness and the
   objects of direct experience.

I am not a professional philosopher. It has been at least ten years since I
studied philosophy in University. I never really directly studied ontology or
phenomenology outside of my own personal investigations and my studies of
Aristotle, who is considerably more primitive in his understanding of these
subjects than, say, Husserl or Heidegger.

But. These differences between these two seem distinct to me. Ontology is
objective: it is the study of being as it is. Phenomenology is subjective, it is
the study of the nature of being from the perspective of an observer. The only
way to understand ontology *may in fact be* through the cross-examination of
results from phenomenological methods.

But I think that I am getting hung up on an ontological understanding of
violence where the real distinction between material and psychological violence
is purely phenomenological. That is to say, the distinction between material and
psychological violence resolves to a kind of subjective ontology of events. It
is therefore phenomenological.

Because the experience of physical pain, as opposed to psychological, is
material, pain which is induced by physical sensation, whether physical pain or
psychological, is in fact material violence.

Let me explain.

We have physical and mental pain. We also have material and psychological
violence. Let's not mix them up.

Chinese Water Torture, which is not actually Chinese,

([Chinese Water Torture, Wikipedia][9], accessed 4/24/21)

Dripping water on a person's forehead is quite apparently a very mild form of
change in material state. But the experience is significantly amplified by the
physical sensation of being restrained, and also by the randomness of the drops.

This is material violence. It is not mere insult, it is a physical sensation
which induces mental anguish. It is therefore material cum psychological
violence.

I do not care that both nerve system and the mental processes involved in mental
anguish are, in fact, physical processes (I am operating under a strictly
materialist metaphysical framework, I do not care to dualize or idealize). What
matters is that we phenomenologically experience the violence as physical.

If you'd like to watch the episode of MythBusters on the subject, I will link to
the [YouTube video here][10].

There are scenes of violence, and phrases describing violence, that feel like
milestones in my thinking about violence. This is one of them. The back cover of
this book, The Crossing by Cormac McCarthy, describes it as an "often dreamlike
journey into a country where men meet ghosts and violence strikes as suddenly as
heat lightning." This scene is the epitome of that violent heat lightning.

Another sign-post: I have absolutely no idea when I first heard of this, but
there seems to be a plethora of incidences: a crazed person, typically a
schizophrenic, suddenly shoves someone onto the subway tracks to be killed.
[This][3] [seems][4] [to][5] [happen][6] [a lot][7]. The suddenness and
simplicty of the act, coupled with how violent the result, is positively
stunning. Under any normal circumstances, shoving someone is a fairly mild act.
Sure, it is violent and confrontational, but not murderous, not "extremely
violent". This is a distinctly different affair when the result is someone on a
train track.

I use the word événement very purposefully. The simple translation from the
French is "event" but it's a fascinating word because of its structure. The
suffix "-ment" in French is used a lot, but often seems to "noun" a verb. I
wanted to use the word "eventing" or even "happening" but these are really
annoying words. In the case of "happening" I think it's too associated with an
artistic form called ["Happening"][2]. The meaning of a Happening might actually
be perfect for my purposes but because it's associated with a type of art I'd
rather avoid it. I'll use événement.

I believe that I have concluded my understanding of the nature of violence and
now would like to understand why people can celebrate it while remaining decent
human beings. Why a West Point graduate would celebrate the death of students
over politics. This is why I'm degressing into the exploration of événement.

Event is one of those folk-words or concepts that is poorly defined in our
minds. It's obvious that violence is "evental": that is to say, to experience
violence is to experience a violent event. It is transitory in time, and can
produce lasting effects. The effects are non-evental, they are states, but can
be experienced event-ally: i.e., as sensations. I believe that I have some
thoughts about events that might illuminate the psychology of our West Pointers.

We can think about events in two ways:

1. Metaphysical events: all of existence proceeds along a plane of time which
   consists of a constant stream of events. Each chemical reaction, each
   interchange of ions, is an event. The delineation of events is arbitrary and
   unimportant. Let's think of it like the wave-particle duality: time is the
   wave, events are the particles. They are two interpretations of the same
   phenomenon.
2. Named events: psychological conceptions of a collections of metaphysical
   events which rise to a threshhold of significance such that we can name them.
   This is, for instance, the killing of George Floyd, or the invasion of Crimea
   by Russia. They can be the event of stubbing my toe, or a kiss I shared with
   another human being.

The Naming of an Event I call The Événement. This is why I chose the word
événement. Because named events are made. The edges of an event are universally
fuzzy, but there is no doubt there is a significant process by which we
translate metaphysical events into named events.

Please bear with me, this is exploratory. I have thought about this subject
quite a lot but never tried to formalize it.

Human beings have a habit of compartmentalizing concepts. We can think of words
like named variables in a programming language. Except nearly all of them
consist of arrays of meaning data. The word horse signifies a species of
quadripedal animal that gallops, smells distinctly, makes a whinny, can be
ridden, and is quite skittish. We have all sorts of mental conceptions that
belong to the word horse, but when we're speaking the word we never make a
mental review of all those concepts. The word horse is a stand-in for a
constellation of conceptions pertaining to horse.

Events are a lot like that. When we formulate a named event, it becomes a
stand-in for a collection of metaphysical events. The Stabbing for the victim is
a whole lot more clear than The Stabbing for the reader of the newspaper. The
reader can conceptualize the experience to the extent that they have the
capacity (perhaps they have also been stabbed and can translate the experience;
perhaps not at all). But for the victim, The Stabbing is much more a collection
of metaphysical events than a singular named event. It is much more vivid.

For me, the experience of violence has made the ability to translate named
violent events into conceptions of the metaphysical events much easier. Almost
involuntary. I do my best, quite often, to not look at bad news too closely
because of how painful it can be to involuntarily empathize with too many
people.

I opened this section with the passage I did because of how illustrative it is
of the metaphysical events of violence. It's clear what happened: a man stabbed
a horse. The same is clear with the platform shoves. But describing them as I am
reduces them to their named events. The *experience* of violence is profoundly
traumatizing because of the metaphysical nature of the event, and it is this
metaphysical nature that is most hard to understand for people living in modern
society.

Violence is fast and confusing. Every fight I've witnessed proceeded similarly.
Everyone in the vicinity detects a tension. The way you notice this is by
hearing a raised voice, violent words, or seeing turning heads. I don't want to
say that there's anything "magical" in this experience, but we perceive these
subtle changes almost subliminally and it feels like some kind of supernatural
force. Then, one of the combattants strikes, and the rest is a struggle of
twisting bodies and fists and limbs. The combattants actually seem to devolve
into their constituent limbs rather than human beings. Finally, however the
fight ends, it ends, and the humans reconstitute themselves, and leave. People
talk, because the experience of violence as a spectator is somewhat
exhilarating. It's electric.

There's loads more to discuss about the experience of physical violence.
Concepts like the connection between Thanatos and Eros can be very illuminating.
People feel more alive after violence, because of the connection with death.
Erotic fixation can manifest. Sex in war, rape in war, is directly connected
with the violence, not tangential.

But this essay really isn't about that, though I might write about it at a later
date.

The real reason I wanted to discuss events is because of this distinction
between the literal experience of violence and the second-hand description of
it. The difference between the collection of metaphysical events and the named
event that points to it.

# The Cowardice of Naming and an Unsatisfactory Conclusion

It is far easier to integrate an event as a named event than as a sequence of
painful metaphysical ones. This much is obvious. I think that it's also apparent
that the experience of empathy is intimately linked with the decomposition of a
named event into its constituent metaphysical ones.

Empathy is painful. [So is thinking][14]. There is some debate about the nature
of empathy, and whether or how much [mirror neurons][15] are involved. But the
basic concept of empathy is just experiencing what another experiences through
psychological imagination. It's not the same as sympathy. Sympathy I think of as
lesser empathy: empathy is the psychological experience of another's pain,
sympathy is feeling emotional anguish for another's pain. Pity is closer to
sympathy than empathy.

When we refuse to decompose a named violent event into its constituent
metaphysical events it protects us from the painful experience of empathy. Is
involuntary empathy a form of violence? I'd say obviously not, but this question
definitely exposes cracks in my definitions. Either way, when I refuse to
decompose the named event, in order to avoid empathy, it is certainly an act of
cowardice.

It would be trite, almost pat, to say that the West Pointers have never
experienced violence, therefore lack empathy, cannot break the named event of
Kent State into its constituent parts, and therefore celebrated it. In fact, I
believed this at the start of the essay. As I was describing the événement I was
thinking this was exactly the answer to my initial question. But it's not.

First, there was far more violence in the past than in the present. Far more
people had *experienced* violence in the past than the present. But we're
supposed to believe that people were less bloodthirsty in the past? Absolutely
not! Public hangings were a regular family event! Bloodsport like gladitorial
combat was as regularly attended as we attend the cinema! And lest we forget,
abused individuals are far more likely to become abusers than the non-abused.

Actually, that's not true at all, that last sentence, and I'm going to leave it
so that I can correct it: while it is the case that more than half of the adults
who become abusers were themselves abused, it is not the case that adults who
were physically abused as children are more likely to abuse their children
([NIH, 2015][11]). This is profoundly weird. I think I may be misunderstanding
the import of this study, perhaps it only applies to physical and not sexual
abuse and that's what's significant. I really don't get it. Instapapered for
later.

But my initial point about the past and present stands: people in the past were
significantly more likely to have experienced violence, which, by my
understanding, means they are more capable of empathy. But they were also
significantly more bloodthirsty. Why, then? My model must be wrong.

Or is it? Perhaps there is a tertiary factor. Let's just call it evil. I really
don't mean to describe this supernaturally, and I don't feel like modelling
metaphysical evil, but let's just say that there is some quality to human beings
which is evil. And let's suppose this quality has significantly decreased in the
present. We can easily point to a significant reduction in violence over time.
In fact, one of the fascinating aspects of hunter gatherer tribes is that the
rate of death by murder is exactly the same as that among chimpanzees.

> Warfare was a routine occupation of primitive societies. Some 65% were at war
> continuously, according to Keeley's* estimate, and 87% fought mroe than once a

> billion people. (151-152, [Before The Dawn: Recovering the Lost History of Our
> Ancestors][12] by Nicholas Wade)

\* Lawrence H. Keeley, an archaeologist at the University of Illinois at Chicago

So what the hell is it that causes a person to be bloodthirsty, to celebrate
death? Clearly there is some level of otherization. I am of the belief that all
forms of prejudice and racism are just types of otherization. The West Pointers
identify as an in-group out-of-which they identify the Kent Staters. This is
obviously related to politics, and all politics are in reality Identity
Politics. Because we identify ourselves by our politics. This itself may be a
modern phenomena, but really, what did people identify themselves before?
Religion? I think the distinction between politics and religion is somewhat
arbitrary. In fact, I think the distinction was probably more clear when
religion was more common. Fascinatingly, it seems to me there was only a brief
period when the religious instincts of humanity were separate from the political
instincts (probably best marked as the nineteenth and early twentieth
centuries). This is a subject for another essay.

I don't know if I'm beginning to systematize my philosophy, but I don't think
that I can answer my question with the tools I've built in it. Or, perhaps,
because I'm already at 5500 words, I'd rather not spend even more words when I
feel like I've made so little progress on my initial question. Or perhaps I just
don't like how prosaic the answer seems to me:

People celebrate violence because they are evil and see the victim as other.
Everyone has a little bit of evil, and everyone sees someone as other.

It actually takes effort to see no one as other. Liberals, I believe, otherize
the least amount of people. But they definitely otherize. I feel less sympathy
for conservatives. This is wrong, and I know it, but it is a fact. Does it mean
I should practice empathy for conservatives? Definitely. I think I could write a
decent essay justifying my contempt for conservatives. But I won't, and
shouldn't, because the justification of contempt is not healthy.

I want to specify that by conservatives I mean the modern American conservative
movement which I think would be more accurately described as reactionary than
"conservative". I should probably write a more formal description of political
orientation, but for now, if you're interested, you can check out my [negroni
article][13].

I'll leave you here, dear reader. I've written enough, and you've read enough.

One final thought I never found the space to work in: according to Nature
magazine, psychological torture is routinely experienced as worse than physical
torture ([Nature, 2007][16]). I think there's more to explore here. It implies
the mental state of the victim is more profound than I've given it credit for
even here.
