Lately, I've been learning C. Or re-learning, since I learned it (badly) years
ago. I went through the course work on [learn-c.org][0] and am now working
through [this cool tutorial][1] on building your own editor in C.

I'm interested in scientific computing, and one opportunity I'm interested in
would require me to learn C++, so I think I might start learning it (beyond the
little I've gotten from Arduino).

That opportunity will also greatly benefit from more ML, so soon I'll start
working through more of Kaggle's course work.

I was toying with the idea of learning Go or Rust, but Rust still seems pretty
niche, and Go is not as useful as the Gophers make it out to be. Sure it's fast,
but I think learning C/C++ may be more useful in the real world for a while. I
went through the Go tutorial, but not much farther than that.
