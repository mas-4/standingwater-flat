This project is ongoing, as the company consistently wants more modules and
modes to the system. It is a touch screen interface for a laser system designed
to treat skin conditions like vitiligo and psoriasis.

I learned a lot about working with alternate tech stacks in this project, and
boned up on my statically typed programming as well. It's a lot of fun working
with other programmers and dealing with hardware.

- Worked with [Euler Sci][0]'s Tom Reinke to develop an interface for Strata's
  dermatological laser system.
- Development used C# and WPF along with SQLite for the database.
- Design for the interface was handled by a third party company out of Israel.
