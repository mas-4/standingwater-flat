I was one of those young people that hated coffee. Hated it. Sometime in my late
twenties that changed, hard. I discovered the pleasure of black, third wave
coffee.

I once counted all the methods of coffee I have the ability to brew at a
moment's notice and it was around thirteen. I mostly make V60 but on the
weekends I'll do a nice Americano with my Flair or a pot of Syphon coffee.

I roast my own a lot these days, with a popcorn popper I rigged up with an
Arduino for PID control (see my projects page) and [Artisan Scope][1].

Have you ever tried dropping a quarter ounce of fresh espresso into a Negroni?
Mein gott.
